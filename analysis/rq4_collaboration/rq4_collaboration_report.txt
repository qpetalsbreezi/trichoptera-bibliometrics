KEY FINDINGS
------------

1. Applied vs Taxonomic Collaboration:
   Applied studies: 1.00 authors (mean)
   Taxonomic studies: 1.00 authors (mean)
   Hypothesis NOT SUPPORTED: 
   Applied studies are less collaborative

2. Temporal Trend:
   Authorship has decreased 
   from 1.00 to 1.00 authors per paper

3. Collaboration Patterns:
   0.0% 
   of papers have 3+ authors (multi-author collaboration)

LIMITATIONS
-----------
- **CRITICAL**: Publish or Perish export only includes FIRST AUTHOR in Authors field
- AuthorCount field in export is unreliable (shows 1 for all papers)
- Collaboration analysis severely limited - cannot accurately determine multi-author papers
- International collaboration analysis limited by country data availability
- Study type classification based on Research_Theme field
- **RECOMMENDATION**: For proper collaboration analysis, use Scopus API or full export 
  that includes all authors, not just first author
