Female body sizes were converted to dry body weight. Variation in body weight and fecundity was expressed as percentage deviation from the median values. The increase in fecundity with body weight was similar in most taxa, with only a few important exceptions. The common regression for oviparous and larviparous species predicts a 0.95% increase in median fecundity for each 1% increase in dry body weight. The number of ovarioles (in 10 species of Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera and Orthoptera) also increased with body weight. The general relationship predicted a 0.81% increase in ovariole number for each 1% increase in dry body weight. The slope of ovariole number versus weight relationship was greater in species with many ovarioles than in species with few. The common slope of the fecundity/size relationship is close to 1 and this indicates that female size is a principal constraint on insect potential fecundity.",,

Exemplar outgroup taxa were Collembola (1 sequence), Archaeognatha (1), Ephemerida (1), Odonata (2), Plecoptera (2), Blattodea (1), Mantodea (1), Dermaptera (1), Orthoptera (1), Phasmatodea (1), Embioptera (1), Psocoptera (1), Phthiraptera (1), Hemiptera (4), and Thysanoptera (1). Exemplar ingroup taxa were Coleoptera: Archostemata (1), Adephaga (2), and Polyphaga (7); Megaloptera (1); Raphidioptera (1); Neuroptera (sensu stricto = Planipennia): Mantispoidea (2), Hemerobioidea (2), and Myrmeleontoidea (2); Hymenoptera: Symphyta (4) and Apocrita (19); Trichoptera: Hydropsychoidea (1) and Limnephiloidea (2); Lepidoptera: Ditrysia (3); Siphonaptera: Pulicoidea (1) and Ceratophylloidea (2); Mecoptera: Meropeidae (1), Boreidae (1), Panorpidae (1), and Bittacidae (2); Diptera: Nematocera (1), Brachycera (2), and Cyclorrhapha (1); and Strepsiptera: Corioxenidae (1), Myrmecolacidae (1), Elenchidae (1), and Stylopidae (3). We analyzed approximately 1 kilobase of 18S rDNA, starting 398 nucleotides downstream of the 5' end, and approximately 400 bp of 28S rDNA in expansion segment D3. Multiple alignment of the 18S and 28S sequences resulted in 1,116 nucleotide positions with 24 insert regions and 398 positions with 14 insert regions, respectively. All Strepsiptera and Neuroptera have large insert regions in 18S and 28S. The secondary structure of 18S insert 23 is composed of long stems that are GC rich in the basal Strepsiptera and AT rich in the more derived Strepsiptera. A matrix of 176 morphological characters was analyzed for holometabolous orders. Incongruence length difference tests indicate that the 28S + morphological data sets are incongruent but that 28S + 18S, 18S + morphology, and 28S + 18S + morphology fail to reject the hypothesis of congruence. Phylogenetic trees were generated by parsimony analysis, and clade robustness was evaluated by branch length, Bremer support, percentage of extra steps required to force paraphyly, and sensitivity analysis using the following parameters: gap weights, morphological character weights, methods of data set combination, removal of key taxa, and alignment region. The following are monophyletic under most or all combinations of parameter values: Holometabola, Polyphaga, Megaloptera + Raphidioptera, Neuroptera, Hymenoptera, Trichoptera, Lepidoptera, Amphiesmenoptera (Trichoptera + Lepidoptera), Siphonaptera, Siphonaptera + Mecoptera, Strepsiptera, Diptera, and Strepsiptera + Diptera (Halteria). Antliophora (Mecoptera + Diptera + Siphonaptera + Strepsiptera), Mecopterida (Antliophora + Amphiesmenoptera), and Hymenoptera + Mecopterida are supported in the majority of total evidence analyses. Mecoptera may be paraphyletic because Boreus is often placed as sister group to the fleas; hence, Siphonaptera may be subordinate within Mecoptera. The 18S sequences for Priacma (Coleoptera: Archostemata), Colpocaccus (Coleoptera: Adephaga), Agulla (Raphidioptera), and Corydalus (Megaloptera) are nearly identical, and Neuropterida are monophyletic only when those two beetle sequences are removed from the analysis. Coleoptera are therefore paraphyletic under almost all combinations of parameter values. Halteria and Amphiesmenoptera have high Bremer support values and long branch lengths. The data do not support placement of Strepsiptera outside of Holometabola nor as sister group to Coleoptera. We reject the notion that the monophyly of Halteria is due to long branch attraction because Strepsiptera and Diptera do not have the longest branches and there is phylogenetic congruence between molecules, across the entire parameter space, and between morphological and molecular data.",,

This approach holds much potential for predicting changes of both species and species assemblages along environmental gradients in terms of traits that are sensitive to local environmental conditions. Further, in the burgeoning field of biomonitoring, a functional approach provides a predictive basis for understanding community-level responses along gradients of environmental alteration caused by humans. Despite much progress in recent years, the full potential of the functional traits-based approach is currently limited by several factors, both conceptual and methodological. Most notably, we lack adequate understanding of how individual traits are intercorrelated and how this lack of independence among traits reflects phylogenetic (evolutionary) constraint. A better understanding is needed if we are to make the transition from a largely univariate approach that considers single-trait responses along single environmental gradients to a multivariate one that more realistically accounts for the responses of many traits across multiple environmental gradients characteristic of most human-dominated landscapes. Our primary objective in this paper is to explore the issue of inter-trait correlations for lotic insects and to identify opportunities and challenges for advancing the theory and application of traits-based approaches in stream community ecology. We created a new database on species-trait composition of North American lotic insects. Using published accounts and expert opinion, we collected information on 20 species traits (in 59 trait states) that fell into 4 broad categories: life-history, morphological, mobility, and ecological. First, we demonstrate the importance of considering how the linkage of specific trait states within a taxon is critical to developing a more-robust traits-based community ecology. Second, we examine the statistical correlations among traits and trait states for the 311 taxa to identify trait syndromes and specify which traits provide unique (uncorrelated) information that can be used to guide trait selection in ecological studies. Third, we examine the evolutionary associations among traits by mapping trait states onto a phylogentic tree derived from morphological and molecular analyses and classifications from the literature. We examine the evolutionary lability of individual traits by assessing the extent to which they are unconstrained by phylogenic relationships across the taxa. By focusing on the lability of traits within lotic genera of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera, taxa often used as water-quality indicators, we show how a traits-based approach can allow a priori expectations of the differential response of these taxa to specific environmental gradients. We conclude with some ideas about how specific trait linkages, statistical correlations among traits, and evolutionary lability of traits can be used in combination with a mechanistic understanding of trait response along environmental gradients to select robust traits useful for a more predictive community ecology. We indicate how these new insights can direct the research in statistical modeling that is necessary to achieve the full potential of models that can predict how multiple traits will respond along multiple environmental gradients.",,

It involves high-throughput sequencing of a standard gene from an environmental sample and comparison to a reference database. However, no consensus has emerged regarding laboratory pipelines to screen species diversity and infer species abundances from environmental samples. In particular, the effect of primer bias and the detection limit for specimens with a low biomass has not been systematically examined, when processing samples in bulk. We developed and tested a DNA metabarcoding protocol that utilises the standard cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) barcoding fragment to detect freshwater macroinvertebrate taxa. DNA was extracted in bulk, amplified in a single PCR step, and purified, and the libraries were directly sequenced in two independent MiSeq runs (300-bp paired-end reads). Specifically, we assessed the influence of specimen biomass on sequence read abundance by sequencing 31 specimens of a stonefly species with known haplotypes spanning three orders of magnitude in biomass (experiment I). Then, we tested the recovery of 52 different freshwater invertebrate taxa of similar biomass using the same standard barcoding primers (experiment II). Each experiment was replicated ten times to maximise statistical power. The results of both experiments were consistent across replicates. We found a distinct positive correlation between species biomass and resulting numbers of MiSeq reads. Furthermore, we reliably recovered 83% of the 52 taxa used to test primer bias. However, sequence abundance varied by four orders of magnitudes between taxa despite the use of similar amounts of biomass. Our metabarcoding approach yielded reliable results for high-throughput assessments. However, the results indicated that primer efficiency is highly species-specific, which would prevent straightforward assessments of species abundance and biomass in a sample. Thus, PCR-based metabarcoding assessments of biodiversity should rely on presence-absence metrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",,

Recovery after drought is rapid by macroinvertebrates that possess strategies to survive drying or are highly mobile but other taxa take longer to recolonise depending on the timing, intensity, and duration of the dry phase. Although drought acts as a sustained ‘ramp’ disturbance, impacts may be disproportionately severe when certain critical thresholds are exceeded. For example, ecological changes may be gradual while a riffle dries but cessation of flow causes abrupt loss of a specific habitat, alteration of physicochemical conditions in pools downstream, and fragmentation of the river ecosystem. Many ecological responses to drought within these habitats apparently depend on the timing and rapidity of hydrological transitions across these thresholds, exhibiting a ‘stepped’ response alternating between gradual change while a threshold is approached followed by a swift transition when a habitat disappears or is fragmented. In two Australian intermittent streams, drought conditions eliminated or decimated several groups of macroinvertebrates, including atyid shrimps, stoneflies and free‐living caddisflies. These taxa persisted during the early stages of the drought but did not recruit successfully the following year, despite a return to higher‐than‐baseflow conditions. This ‘lag effect’ in response to drought emphasises the value of long‐term survey data. Although changes in faunal composition were inconsistent among sites, marked shifts in taxa richness, abundance and trophic organisation after the riffle habitat dried provide evidence for a stepped response. Responses by macroinvertebrate assemblages to droughts of differing severity in English chalk streams were variable. The prolonged 1988–92 drought had a greater impact than shorter droughts in the early 1970s but recovery over the next 3 years was swift. Effects of the 1995 summer drought were buffered by sustained groundwater discharge from the previous winter. These droughts tended to reduce available riverine habitats, especially via siltation, but few taxa were eliminated because they could recolonise from perennial sections of the chalk streams. In the contrasting environments of the intermittent streams studied in England and Australia, there are parallels in the rapid rates of recolonisation. However, recruitment by taxa that lack desiccation‐resistant stages or have limited mobility is delayed. Currently, long‐term data on these systems may be insufficient to indicate persistent effects of droughts or predict the impacts of excessive surface or groundwater abstraction or the increased frequency and duration of droughts expected with global climate change.",,

The aquatic insects that live in these habitats are strongly influenced by 2 main groups of constraints, physicochemical and biological factors. Taxa particularly well-represented in temporary running waters are the Ephemeroptera, Hemiptera, Coleoptera, Trichoptera, and tipulid and chironomid Diptera. With the exception of Ephemeroptera, all these groups are common also in temporary lentic waters, but the latter also support many species of Odonata, together with culicid, ceratopogonid and ephydrid Diptera. In general, however, the diversity of aquatic insects is lower in temporary than in permanent waters. Seasonal succession of species is commonplace in temporary waters, affecting food web structure. Adaptations to drought are reviewed, and traits common to the most successful taxa include a highly flexible life cycle, temperature-linked development, possession of a diapausing or otherwise protected egg, and high powers of dispersal. A trend towards terrestrialisation of immature stages is noted amongst at least some members of even strongly aquatic taxa. Several directions for future research are discussed including study of the controlling influence of the biological environment on the fauna and the former's interaction with physicochemical influences, temporal variation in the structure of food webs, and genetic analyses of populations. A recommendation is made for greater quantification in data collection, particularly on seasonal changes in species abundance, their life histories, and trophic relationships, as this will allow greater opportunity for modelling the community dynamics of these ecologically distinct habitats. Finally, the concept that temporary waters constrain their faunas is exposed as being based more on human perception than on fact.",,

To contribute to this challenge, this paper reports results of a microplastic survey from a heavily urbanised catchment, the River Tame and four of its tributaries, which flows through the city of Birmingham, UK. All sediment sampled was found to contain microplastics with an average abundance of 165 particles kg−1. While urban areas generally have a greater abundance of microplastics as compared with rural, there is no simple relationship between microplastic numbers and population density or proximity to wastewater treatment sites. The greatest change in microplastic abundance was due to the presence of a lake along the course of the River Tame—i.e., flow velocities are reduced on entering the lake, which promotes the deposition of fine sediment and potentially microplastics. This suggests that the greatest concentrations of microplastics will not be found in-channel but rather on the floodplain and other low velocity environments such as meander cutoffs. We also identified a new mechanism of microplastic fixation in freshwater environments through ecological engineers, specifically caddisflies, that incorporated microplastics into their casing. These results highlight the need to explore further hydrodynamic and ecological impacts on microplastics fate and transport in rivers.",,

The aim of this paper is to review literature on species diversity patterns of freshwater organisms and underlying mechanisms at large spatial scales. 2. Some freshwater taxa (e.g. dragonflies, fish and frogs) follow the classical latitudinal decline in regional species richness (RSR), supporting the patterns found for major terrestrial and marine organism groups. However, the mechanisms causing this cline in most freshwater taxa are inadequately understood, although research on fish suggests that energy and history are major factors underlying the patterns in total species and endemic species richness. Recent research also suggests that not all freshwater taxa comply with the decline of species richness with latitude (e.g. stoneflies, caddisflies and salamanders), but many taxa show more complex geographical patterns in across-regions analyses. These complexities are even more profound when studies of global, continental and regional extents are compared. For example, clear latitudinal gradients may be present in regional studies but absent in global studies (e.g. macrophytes). 3. Latitudinal gradients are often especially weak in the across-ecosystems analyses, which may be attributed to local factors overriding the effects of large-scale factors on local communities. Nevertheless, local species richness (LSR) is typically linearly related to RSR (suggesting regional effects on local diversity), although saturating relationships have also been found in some occasions (suggesting strong local effects on diversity). Nestedness has often been found to be significant in freshwater studies, yet this pattern is highly variable and generally weak, suggesting also a strong beta diversity component in freshwater systems. 4. Both geographical location and local environmental factors contribute to variation in alpha diversity, nestedness and beta diversity in the freshwater realm, although the relative importance of these two groups of explanatory variables may be contingent on the spatial extent of the study. The mechanisms associated with spatial and environmental control of community structure have also been inferred in a number of studies, and most support has been found for species sorting (possibly because many freshwater studies have species sorting as their starting point), although also dispersal limitation and mass effects may be contributing to the patterns found. 5. The lack of latitudinal gradients in some freshwater taxa begs for further explanations. Such explanations may not be gained for most freshwater taxa in the near future, however, because we lack species-level information, floristic and faunistic knowledge, and standardised surveys along extensive latitudinal gradients. A challenge for macroecology is thus to use the best possible species-level information on well-understood groups (e.g. fish) or use surrogates for species-level patterns (e.g. families) and then develop hypotheses for further testing in the freshwater realm. An additional research challenge concerns understanding patterns and mechanisms associated with the relationships between alpha, beta and gamma components of species diversity. 6. Understanding the mechanistic basis of species diversity patterns should preferably be based on a combination of large-scale macroecological and landscape-scale metacommunity research. Such a research approach will help in elucidating patterns of species diversity across regional and local scales in the freshwater realm.",,

Medians and 10–90 percentiles for the following community level characteristics were: taxa richness, 14 and 7–20(0.7 m−2); Shannon Diversity (H'), 1.33and 0.80–1.90; total density, 1900 and 230–6700 m−2; and total biomass, 0.608 and 0.112–2.932 g AFDW m−2. Invertebrate abundance and taxonomic richness were lowest in rivers with beds of silt or sand, or cobbles overlain with sand deposits. Comparisons of environmental factors between sites grouped by TWINSPAN indicated that the degree of catchment development to improved pasture, water temperature, and level of enrichment (indicated by increased nutrients and periphyton biomass) are important factors affecting invertebrate community structure in New Zealand rivers. Mayflies, stoneflies, and predatory caddisflies were associated with cooler, less enriched, steeper, and more elevated sites than snails, crustaceans, chironomids, and worms. Stonefly biomass was minimal at sites having mean annual temperatures >13°C. The following community characteristics emerged as useful indicators of the level of water enrichment: the Macroinvertebrate Community Index (MCI) and its quantitative analog (QMCI); the presence of some species (e.g., Zelandoperla decorata and Bereoptera roria), and the densities of some widely distributed taxa (e.g., Deleatidium spp. and Psilochorema spp.); percentage predator biomass; and the number of ephemeropteran, plecopteran, and trichopteran taxa (EPT). Sites did not separate out clearly into ecoregions, although rivers with ""clean‐water"" faunas were more predominant in the South Island than in the North Island. This is thought to reflect the greater degree of development of the North Island catchments.

At the primary producer level, both algal biomass and productivity increased and cholorophyll accumulated on the river bottom in the first two summers. Diatom community composition changed little in spite of large chorophyll changes. However, an increase in grazing insects prevented chlorophyll buildup in the third and fourth summers. Some microbial processes were also stimulated by the increased photosynthesis caused by fertilization. Total respiration of the epilithon, acetate uptake, and decomposition of lignin monomers were all stimulated but only in light—grown epilithon. When epilithon was grown in the dark in the fertilized region of the river, there was no increased respiration. Also, phosphorous did not stimulate the decompostition of Carex litter. Although insects grew more rapidly in the fertilized section of the river, there were community interactions that kept total insect production from appreciable change. The four most abundant large insects did increase their growth rates in response to phosphorus addition and there were increases in populations of Baetis lapponicus and Brachycentrus americanus. These increases were offset by the decline in abundance of the dominant species, the black fly Prosimulium martini, perhaps caused by competition for space from Brachycentrus. Growth of both young—of—the—year and adult grayling (Thymallus arcticus) was strongly stimulated by phosphorus addition in years 3 and 4 (not tested in years 1 and 2). Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope tracers indicated that the measured increases in insect and fish growth were largely attributable to increases in the production of epilithic algae. Overall, the results indicate a strong ""bottom—up"" response of the riverine food web to additions of the limiting nutrient, phosphorus. The response was modified in later years, however, by a strong ""top—down"" feedback of insects grazing on epilithic algae and by competitive exclusion of black flies caddisflies.",,

This review examines ecological conditions and zoobenthic communities of kryal, krenal and rhithral streams of the alpine zone. Altitudinal and biogeographical faunal patterns are also analysed. 2. Kryal segments, fed by glacial meltwater, are characterized by low temperatures ( T max 4°C) and large diel flow fluctuations in summer. The water may be clear or turbid from suspended rock flour. Fishes and higher plants are absent. The macroalga Hydrurus foetidus may be abundant in kryal and other alpine stream types of the Holarctic. The highly restricted cosmopolitan fauna of glacial brooks consists of diamesine chironomids, sometimes accompanied by simuliids. Sparse food resources include algae and allochthonous (aeolian) organic matter. 3. Rhithral segments in alpine catchments are characterized by soft water, a hydrograph dominated by an extended period of snowmelt runoff, and a broader temperature range than kryal or krenal biotopes. Bryophytes, macroalgae (chrysophytes, chlorophytes, cyanophytes, rhodophytes) and epiphytic and epilithic diatoms constitute the flora. A relatively diverse zoobenthos includes four orders of insects (Flecoptera, Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera, Diptera), turbellarians, acarines, oligochaetes and nematodes. 4. Krenal segments, fed by groundwater, are typically calcareous with summer‐cool and winter‐warm thermal conditions, high water clarity, and constant flow regimes. Bryophytes and macroafgae are accompanied by a rich diatom flora. The zoobenthos consists of a composite of kryal and rhithral elements with few crenobionts. Zoobenthos species richness values are intermediate between those of kryal and rhithral segments, whereas densities in perennial, well‐oxygenated springbrooks far exceed those in other alpine stream types. 5. Downstream faunal changes are most predictable in kryal segments where chironomids of the genus Diamesa are the predominant, if not sole, members of the zoobenthos in the upper zone of glacial brooks, the metakryal. Where T max exceeds about 2°C the transition to the hypokryal occurs and Diamesa is co‐dominant with simuliids. These largely stenozonal headwater forms decline downstream where T max exceeds about 4°C, concomitant with a marked increase in the euryzonal mountain fauna. 6. Species occurring in alpine rhithral biotopes tend to be euryzonal forms at their upper alrirudinal limits, whereas the lower elevation mountain stream fauna consists of species with narrower distribution limits. There is, however, a precipitous drop in mean altitudinal range from the alpine rhithral to the kryat because of the stenozonal nature of the glacial brook fauna. 7. The view that effects of temperature on generation time and mutation rate determine the speed at which selection proceeds is consistent with altitudinal species richness patterns exhibited by zoobenthos along the alrirudinal gradient and may provide an evolutionary explanation for the low faunal diversity in alpine headwaters. 8. With increasing altitude, mountain ‘islands’ become progressively insular as area decreases and isolation increases. For a cold‐adapted stream fauna the insular nature of mountain tops is greatest in the tropics. Nonetheless, alpine stream faunas generally",,

However, despite probable hydrological change as alpine glaciers and snowpacks shrink, links between alpine stream biota and reduced meltwater input are virtually unknown. Using data from the French Pyrénées, we demonstrate that taxonomic richness and total abundance of stream macroinvertebrates increase significantly as meltwater (snow melt and glacier melt) contributions to river flow decrease. Macroinvertebrate species showed a gradation of optimum meltwater conditions at which they persist. For example: Habroleptoides berthelemyi (Ephemeroptera), Perla grandis (Plecoptera) and Rhithrogena spp. (Ephemeroptera) increased in abundance when meltwater contributions to streamflow decrease, whereas in contrast, Rhyacophila angelieri (Trichoptera) and Diamesa latitarsis spp. (Diptera) decreased in abundance. Changes in alpine stream macroinvertebrate community composition as meltwater contributions decline were associated with lower suspended sediment concentration, and higher water temperature, electrical conductivity and pH. Our results suggest α diversity (at a site) of streams presently fed by meltwaters will increase with future meltwater reductions. However, β diversity (between‐sites) will be reduced as snow melt and glacier melt decrease because the habitat heterogeneity associated with spatiotemporal variability of water source contributions will become lower as meltwater contributions decline. Extinction of some endemic alpine aquatic species (such as the Pyrenean caddis fly R. angelieri ) is predicted with reduced meltwater inputs, leading to decreases in γ diversity (region). Our identification of significant links between meltwater production and stream macroinvertebrate biodiversity has wider implications for the conservation of alpine river ecosystems under scenarios of climate change induced glacier and snowpack loss.",,

In this Mediterranean climate, rainy winters precede the biologically active summer low‐flow season. Cladophora glomerata , the filamentous green alga that dominates primary producer biomass during summer, reaches peak biomass during late spring or early summer. Cladophora blooms are larger if floods during the preceding winter attained or exceeded “bankfull discharge” (sufficient to mobilize much of the river bed, estimated at 120 m 3 /s). In 9 out of 12 summers preceded by large bed‐scouring floods, the average peak height of attached Cladophora turfs equaled or exceeded 50 cm. In five out of six years when flows remained below bankfull, Cladophora biomass peaked at lower levels. Flood effects on algae were partially mediated through impacts on consumers in food webs. In three experiments that followed scouring winter floods, juvenile steelhead ( Oncorhynchus mykiss ) and roach ( Lavinia ( Hesperoleucas ) symmetricus ) suppressed certain insects and young‐of‐the‐year fish fry, affecting persistence or accrual of algae positively or negatively, depending on the predator‐specific vulnerabilities of primary consumers capable of suppressing algae during a given year. During two post‐flood years, these grazers were more vulnerable to small predators (odonates and fish fry, which stocked steelhead always suppressed) than to experimentally manipulated, larger fish, which had adverse effects on algae in those years. During one post‐flood year, all enclosed grazers capable of suppressing algae were consumed by steelhead, which therefore had positive effects on algae. During drought years, when no bed‐scouring winter flows occurred, large armored caddisflies ( Dicosmoecus gilvipes ) were more abundant during the subsequent summer. In drought‐year experiments, stocked fish had little or no influence on algal standing crops, which increased only when Dicosmoecus were removed from enclosures. Flood scour, by suppressing invulnerable grazers, set the stage for fish mediated effects on algae in this river food web. Whether these effects were positive or negative depended on the predator‐specific vulnerabilities of primary consumers that dominated during a given summer.",,

By elevating artificial substrate tiles above the stream bottom, larvae of Helicopsyche, but not other herbivorous insects, were effectively excluded. In three replicate experiments, grazing by Helicopsyche resulted in low amounts of algae (as chlorophyll a, 0.3—1.4 mg/cm 2 ) and bacteria (0.3—0.7 ° 10 8 cells/cm 2 ) but a high algal turnover rate (O 2 evolved per unit chlorophyll a = 34 mg°mg — 1 h — 1 ). When larvae were excluded, higher amounts of algae (as chlorophyll a, 8.1—15.1 mg/cm 2 ) and bacteria (1.9—4.8 ° 10 8 cells/cm 2 ) were present, but the algal turnover rate (O 2 evolved per unit chlorophyll a ° 7 μ°μ — 1 h — 1) was lower. In a second set of field experiments, the effects of periphyton on the density and spatial distribution of grazers were assessed by varying the standing crop of periphyton. Nearest—neighbor analysis indicated that Helicopsyche larvae were aggregated on periphyton with higher standing crop than that which was present as background levels on surrounding substrate. Such larvae became randomly distributed after their grazing reduced the experimentally enhanced periphyton to the background levels. Helicopsyche's grazing resulted in a diatom—dominated algal community with a low standing crop that, because of a high turnover rate, was able to support a high biomass of consumers. This high rate of production probably occurred because competition for light and nutrients was less severe in the grazed than in the ungrazed periphyton.",,

We estimated the lateral dispersal of adult aquatic insects (Plecoptera, Trichoptera, Ephemeroptera) in seven small, upland streams draining catchments under three categories of land use (coniferous plantation forest, cleared forest, moorland). Malaise traps were set out in transects perpendicular to each stream. More than 29 000 adult insects were taken, distributed among 15 species of stoneflies, 40 species of caddisflies and eight taxa of mayflies. Overall species diversity and equitability were highest in the moorland catchments, and few species were numerous in all catchments. Nearly all the mayflies were taken in the moorland catchments, where caddisflies were also most abundant. Fewest stoneflies were taken in the forested catchments. The vast majority of insects were taken either directly over, or very close to, the stream channel. Half the stoneflies were taken within 18 m of the channel, while 90% had travelled less than 60 m. Caddisflies and mayflies travelled even shorter distances. Although there were differences in lateral dispersal between some catchments, there was no overall effect of land use. The overall sex ratio in stoneflies and mayflies in the riparian zone was close to 1 : 1 and lateral dispersal was similar between the sexes. Male mayflies outnumbered females in the riparian zone and males travelled further from the stream, on average, than females. In catches taken directly over the stream, female stoneflies outnumbered males. Regardless of land use, the flight of mayflies and caddisflies was concentrated along the stream, rather than perpendicular to it. This was also true for two numerous stoneflies ( Amphinemura sulcilcollis and Protonemura meyeri ) and for female stoneflies overall. Synthesis and applications . The stream corridor, including the riparian strip extending 10–20 m on either side of the channel, is the main habitat for adult aquatic insects, and its management may affect the biodiversity of aquatic communities. The stream corridor is also revealed as the main ‘highway’ for adult dispersal.

The evidence for Hennig'S (1969) hierarchial classification of the higher hexapodan taxa (here termed ""orders"") is reviewed and additional data are considered. 2. The monophyly of the Hexapoda and the sister group relationship between Entognatha and Insecta (Archaeognatha + Zygentoma + Pterygota) are accepted. MANTON'S theory of an independent origin of Diplura, Protura, Collemboia, Thysanura (s. lat.) and Pterygota is found to be based on an unwarranted importance attached to autapomorphies and on inadequate considerations of those ancestral stages considered by Manton to be ""functionally impossible"". 3. The monophyly of Hennig'S taxon Dicondylia (Zygentoma + Pterygota) is accepted and substantiated by further evidence. 4. A taxon constituted by the recent palaeopteran orders, Ephemeroptera and Odonata, is not accepted as monophyletic, the latter order being considered the sister group of the Neoptera. 5. The phylogenetic interrelationships of the lower neopteran orders (Plecoptera + Pauro-metabola sensu HENNIG) are considered entirely unclarified. HENNIG'S classification as well as the theories on supraordinal relationships by, e. g., BLACKITH and BLACKITH (1968), GILES (1963), RICHARDS and DAVIES (1957), Ross (1965), RÄHLE (1970), SHAROV (1968/71) and WILLE (1960) are shown to be very weakly founded, but construction of an alternative classification is not attempted. The monophyletic nature of the order Blattopteroidea (Man-todea + Blattariae + Isoptera) is considered firmly established. 6. The ground plan of the Phasmatodea is inadequately known. The current primary division of the order is questioned, and the Californian genus Timema is suggested to be the primitive sister-group of all other Phasmatodea together. 7. The monophyly of the taxon ""Eumetabola"" (Paraneoptera + Holometabola) is substantiated only by its possession of a ""jugal bar"" (HAMILTON 1972). SHAROV'S (1966) account of the phylogenetic significance of embryonic growth patterns in the major pterygote division is discarded. 8.HENNIG'S theory of the paraneopteran nature of the Zoraptera is preferred to theories of blattopteroid affinities of this order. Assumedly specific zorapteran-isopteran similarities are invalidated by those characters in the Zoraptera (corpotentorium, female subgenital plate) which show that this order could at most have been the sister-group of the Blatto-pteroidea as a whole. 9. The monophyly of the entities Psocodea (Psocoptera + Phthiraptera) and Condylognatha (Hemiptera + Thysanoptera) is accepted. It is likely that the Psocoptera is paraphyletic in terms of Phthiraptera. HENNIG'S subdivisions of the Hemiptera: Heteropteroidea (including Coleorrhyncha), Auchenorrhyncha and Sternorrhyncha are accepted. 10. MICKOLEIT'S (1973) findings concerning the ovipositor-structures provide the most weighty evidence for the monophyly of the Neuropteroidea (Megaloptera + Raphidioptera + Neuroptera) and for the relationship of this group to the Coleoptera. Following KINZEL-BACH (1971), the Strepsiptera is tentatively placed as the sister-group of the Coleoptera. 11. HENNIG'S suggestion of a sister-group relationship between the Hymenoptera and the Mecopteroidea probably provides the best working hypothesis of the position of the former group. 12. The Mecopteroidea and its two sub-groups Amphiesmenoptera (Trichoptera + Lepido-ptera) and Antliophora (Mecoptera + Siphonaptera + Diptera) are considered mono-phyletic entities. The arguments, mentioned by HENNIG, against the inclusion of the Siphonaptera in the Mecopteroidea are discarded, and evidence is provided for a sister-group relationship between this order and Mecoptera (including Neomecoptera). The Zeugloptera are true Lepidoptera. Zusammenfassung Die Stammesgeschichte der ""Ordnungen"" der Hexapoden. Eine kritische Beurteilung des heutigen Wissens 1. Die Grundlagen der hierarchischen Klassifikation der höheren Taxa der Hexapoden (hier ""Ordnungen"" genannt) von HENNIG (1969) werden überprüft und durch zusätzliche Daten beurteilt. 2. Die Monophylie der Hexapoda und die Schwestergruppen-Beziehungen zwischen Ento-gnatha und Insecta (Archaeognatha + Zygentoma + Pterygota) werden übernommen. Es wird gezeigt, daß die Theorie von MANTON über einen eigenen Ursprung der Diplura, Protura, Collembola, Thysanura (s. lat.) und Pterygota begründet ist auf einer nicht ge-rechtfertigten Betonung von Autapomorphien und auf unangemessenen Erwagungen iiber jene ancestralen Stufen, die MANTON als ""funktionell unmöglich"" bezeichnet. 3. Die Monophylie von HENNIGS Taxon Dicondylia (Zygentoma + Pterygota) wird ubernommen und durch weitere Befunde untermauert. 4. Nicht anerkannt als monophyletisch wird ein Taxon, welches aus den rezenten palaeopteren Ordnungen Ephemeroptera und Odonata gebildet wurde. Die Odonata werden als die Schwestergruppe der Neoptera erachtet. 5. Die stammesgeschichtlichen Beziehungen der Ordnungen der niederen Neoptera (Pleco-ptera + Paurometabola sensu HENNIG) werden als völlig ungeklärt bezeichnet. Sowohl die Klassifikation durch HENNIG als auch die Theorien von Überordnungsbeziehungen, vertre-ten durch BLACKITH und BLACKITH (1968), GILES (1963), RICHARDS und DAVIES (1957), Ross (1965), RAHLE (1970), SHAROV (1968/71) und WILLE (1960) sind sehr schwach begriindet; eine alternative Klassifikation wird aber nicht versucht. Die Monophylie der Ordnung Blattopteroidae (Mantodea + Blattariae + Isoptera) wird als wohl begründet angesehen. 6. Der Grundplan der Phasmatodea ist ungenügend bekannt. Die derzeitige Gliederung der Ordnung wird in Frage gestellt und die kalifornische Gattung Timema als die primitive Schwestergruppen aller anderen Phasmatodea erachtet. 7. Die Monophylie des Taxons ""Eumetabola"" (Paraneoptera + Holometabola) gründet sich nur auf den Besitz eines ""jugal bar"" (HAMILTON 1972). SHAROVS (1966) Hinweis auf die phylogenetische Bedeutung des embryonalen Wachstumsmusters wird verworfen. 8. HENNIGS Theorie von der paraneopteren Natur der Zoraptera wird gegenüber den Theorien einer blattopteroiden Verwandtschaft dieser Ordnung der Vorzug gegeben. Hervor-gehobene besondere Ähnlichkeiten zwischen Zoraptera und Isoptera werden bedeutungslos, weil andere Eigenarten der Zoraptera (Corpotentorium, weibliche Subgenitalplatte) darauf hinweisen, daß diese Ordnung höchstens als die Schwestergruppe der Blattopteroidea in ihrer Gesamtheit gelten kann. 9. Die Monophylie der Einheiten Psocodea (Pocoptera + Phthiraptera) und Condylognatha (Hemiptera + Thysanoptera) wird übernommen. Es ist wahrscheinlidi, daß die Psocoptera paraphyletisdi mit Rücksicht auf die Phthiraptera sind. HENNIGS Untergliederung der Hemiptera in Heteropteroidea (einsdiließlich Coleorrhyncha), Auchenorrhyndia und Sternor-rhyncha wird anerkannt. 10. MICKOLEITS (1973) Eeststellungen an den Ovipositor-Strukturen stellen die widitigsten Grundlagen für eine Monophylie der Neuropteroidea (Megaloptera + Raphidioptera + Neuroptera) dar sowie für Beziehungen dieser Gruppe zu den Coleoptera. Gemäß KINZEL-BACH (1971) werden die Strepsiptera zÖgernd als Schwestergruppe der Coleoptera be-zeichnet. 11. HENNIGS Annahme einer Schwestergruppenbeziehung zwischen Hymenoptera und den Mecopteroidea ist wahrscheinlidi die beste Arbeitshypothese Über die Stellung der erst-genannten Gruppe. 12. Die Mecopteroidea und ihre zwei Untergruppen Amphiesmenoptera (Tridioptera + Lepido-ptera) und Antliophora (Mecoptera + Siphonaptera+Diptera) werden als monophyletisch eraditet. Die von HENNIG genannten Argumente gegen die Einbeziehung der Siphonaptera in die Mecopteroidea werden nicht ubernommen; es werden Hinweise darauf gemacht, dafi zwischen dieser Gruppe und Mecoptera (einschließlich Neomecoptera) Sdiwestergruppen-beziehungen bestehen. Die Zeugloptera sind echte Lepidoptera.",,

Indices were calculated from quantitative monthly or bimonthly benthic samples of moss‐covered rockface and mixed substrate habitats, as well as habitat‐weighted values based on the proportion of each habitat in the two streams. One stream (C 55) served as a reference stream over the 6‐yr period of late 1984 through 1990, whereas the other (C 54) received seasonal treatments with an insecticide for 3 yr (1986‐1988). Throughout pretreatment, treatment, and recovery, both the NCBI and EPT indices tracked the disturbance regime of the treatment stream. Indices for the reference stream varied little during the 6‐yr period. Both the NCBI and EPT suggested strong changes in the treatment stream during treatment relative to both pretreatment and the reference stream. Following cessation of insecticide treatments, both indices reflected improved biotic conditions during first and second years of recovery in C 54. Compared with fauna of mixed substrates, rockface fauna had lower (better) NCBI values during pretreatment, and exhibited a greater proportional increase in tolerant taxa during treatment than mixed substrates, emphasizing the importance of including rockface communities in environmental monitoring programs. Changes in both the EPT and NCBI indices closely corresponded to changes in ecosystem‐level processes observed in C 54 from pretreatment to treatment, and recovery periods. These processes include: leaf litter processing rates, organic matter storage, fine particulate organic matter generation and export, and secondary production. With the exception of organic matter storage, all of these processes declined during treatment of C 54, and subsequently increased during recovery. Our results demonstrate the potential of such indices to detect and monitor stream ecosystem changes during and following disturbance. The EPT index was by far the easiest to use from both the standpoint of time required for sample processing and ease of application. Compared with the labor‐intensive sample processing, specimen identification and measurement, and data entry required for secondary production calculations, the EPT index was relatively simple and displayed a remarkable ability to track secondary production of invertebrates in the treatment stream. Our data strongly support the inclusion of the EPT and NCBI indices in these southern Appalachian headwater streams as indicators of both degradation and recovery of stream ecosystem processes from chemical‐induced disturbance.",,

Long-term food-web studies using stable isotopes are valuable but rare because the required samples are not readily available. We examine the feasibility of using preserved specimens from natural-history collections as a source of long-term data for food-web studies and test whether chemical preservation affects the stable-isotope signature of tissues. We experimentally determined the effects of tissue preservation and fixation with 75% ethanol and 10% formalin, respectively, on δ 13 C and δ 15 N of three aquatic consumers: Sacramento sucker, Catostomus occidentalis, Asian clam, Corbicula fluminea, and a caddisfly, Hydropsyche sp. Using both our results and previously published literature results, we characterize preservation effects across many different consumer taxa including invertebrates, fish, and birds. Overall, only formalin fixation systematically affected isotope signature, causing an average depletion of 1.65 in δ 13 C, a bias that can easily be corrected for prior to interpreting data. Preservation affected mean δ 15 N values with far lower frequency and magnitude, although variability increased with preservation for some taxa but not others. These findings suggest that preserved specimens may be used for stable-isotope analysis and open up the possibility of using archived collections to reconstruct food webs and biogeochemical changes at scales of tens to hundreds of years.",,

A consistent cycle of seasonal change in assemblage composition occurred each year, little altered by spates. Changes reflected variations in presence or absence rather than relative abundance of taxa. Seasonal patterns were confirmed by plotting temporal changes in densities of common taxa. Invertebrate abundance (mostly oligochaetes and mayflies) peaked in spring. ""Summer"" dominants included gastropod Physella virgata and the caddisfly larva Cheumatopsyche arizonensis. Assemblages composition remained relatively consistent during spring over 3 yr when high discharge was prolonged, whereas there was a major change in autumn community structure between 1984 and 1986, probably, reflecting low discharge during a drought in 1986. Drying apparently influenced assemblage composition more than spates, possibly by altering habitat availability and the intensity of biotic interactions as surface stream volume shrank. Assemblage resistance to disturbance by spates was variable. Similarly, resistance of individual common taxa varied within and among taxa, and like assemblage resistance, was not simply a function of spate magnitude or timing (season). Resilience was generally high. Succession rate (degree of change in assemblage composition) decline during succession in all but spring sequences, which displayed no consistent trend. The two summer sequences had highest initial succession rates (in first 30 d postspate), possibly reflecting higher water temperatures, as also exhibited late—successional increases in succession rate. Spatial variation in assemblage composition was uncorrelated with any physical variable measured. Factors known to influence ecosystem—level processes such as primary productivity (e.g., inorganic nitrogen flux, days since spate) also affected community—level aspects such as aquatic invertebrate assemblage composition in Sycamore Creek. Discharge and water temperature had lesser but detectable effects, and probably contributed to the marked seasonality in assemblage composition. Further comparisons of collective properties of ecosystems and communities within other biomes may identify ""common denominators"" that characterize responses to disturbance and environmental change. This will remove the different perceptions about stability we gain by using response variables that are assessed only at a community or ecosystem level.",,

We conducted laboratory experiments with larvae of two strong exploitative competitors of periphyton (the mayfly Baetis tricaudatus and the caddisfly Glossosoma nigrior) to test if and how their foraging behavior was affected by presence of sculpin when sculpin were not allowed to attack prey. We incorporated four experimental factors in a factorial design: sculpin presence/absence, the abundance (low, high) of food that was patchily distributed on the top surface of substrates grazer hunger level (fed, starved), and time of day (day, night). In feeding trials, Baetis was much more vulnerable than Glossosoma to sculpin predation. Similarly, only the foraging behavior of Baetis was strongly affected by the presence of sculpin. Baetis larvae responded to the presence of sculpin by: (1) significantly reducing the time spent on the top surface of substrates, and their movement rate while moving within and between food patches, and (2) significantly increasing the proportion of time spent in food patches, and the proportion of individuals that left the substrate by drifting downstream. Baetis larvae accepted greater risk of predation (by spending more time on top) when food abundance on top was high and when larvae had been starved for 27 h. Also, Baetis behavior was strongly affected by sculpin presence during the day but not at night. Collectively, these results suggest that Baetis larvae made adaptive compromises between feeding and avoiding sculpin. In contrast, Glossosoma behavior was not affected by the presence of sculpin. Glossosoma responded most strongly to alterations in food density and their own hunger level. Our results suggest that the presence of sculpin, even though the fish consumed no larvae, might indirectly affect the outcome of competitive interactions between Baetis and Glossosoma through the grazers' differential behavioral responses to the predator.",,

In the more heavily stressed sections of both streams, macroinvertebrates, other than tubificid worms and chironomids, were virtually eliminated from rock-rubble, riffle habitats. Midge larvae comprised 75 to 86% of all insects collected from the most grossly polluted stations and less than 10% of the insect communities at the least polluted stations. The correlation coefficient for percentage of chironomids in relation to copper concentration was +0.93 (P ≤ 0.01). Changes in the coefficient of variation (CV) of percentage of chironomids per sample exhibited a consistent pattern. The lowest CV was at the most polluted stations and the CV increased along a gradient of decreasing metal concentrations, reaching maximum values at the least polluted stations. The number of species of chironomids was inversely related to the proportional density of the family in samples. In Elam's Run, the number of species of chironomids identified in samples increased from 15 at the most polluted station to 39 at the least polluted stations. Fifty-seven species of midges were collected along the 3-km stretch of this grossly polluted stream. Caddisflies were numerically important at the intermediately polluted stations in both streams. Mayflies occurred only at the least polluted stations. We hypothesize that heavily polluted habitats are dominated by midges, moderately polluted habitats by midges and caddisflies, and minimally polluted or unpolluted habitats by caddisflies and mayflies. Since there appears to be a direct relationship between the fraction of a community composed of chironomids and the degree of pollution, we suggest that the percentage of chironomids in samples may be a useful index of heavy-metal pollution.Key words: heavy metals, stream pollution, chironomids, aquatic insects",,

The sessile caddisfly larva Leucotrichia pictipes is territorial and aggressively eliminates conspecifics and other species from its foraging territories. Territoriality produces an intraspecific pattern of regular spacing and negative spatial associations between Leucotrichia and several other sessile insects: Parargyractis confusalis, Rhetanytarsus sp. and Eukiefferiella sp. Experimental removals of Leucotrichia resulted in higher densities of other sessile species and several mobile insects, including Baetis, Glossosoma, and Simulium. These insects show broad microhabitat overlap with Leucotrichia; competition with Leucotrichia limits their distributions and abundances within otherwise suitable microhabitats. Leucotrichia is the only species that monopolizes large areas of space. Physical disturbances interrupt the formation of competitive monopolies by Leucotrichia. During seasonal reduced flows, Leucotrichia is eliminated from stones and boulders in shallow water. Greater densities of a short—lived sessile species with multiple annual generations occupy this ephemeral spatial resource. On permanently submerged stones, Leucotrichia competitively affects a large part of the benthic fauna. On small stones that overturn with higher frequencies during flooding, Leucotrichia densities are reduced and species' abundance are highly equitable. Larger, more stable substrates with greater densities of Leucotrichia are characterized by lower species evenness.",,

Changes in macrohabitat availability from a riffle–pool sequence to isolated pools are among the most conspicuous consequences of connectivity loss. Macroinvertebrate assemblages were compared among 3 distinct stream macrohabitats (riffles [R], pools connected to riffles [Pc], disconnected pools [Pd]) of 19 Mediterranean-climate sites in northern California to examine the influence of loss of habitat resulting from drought disturbance. At the time of sampling, 10 sites were perennial and included R and Pc macrohabitats, whereas 9 sites were intermittent and included only Pd macrohabitats. Taxa richness was more variable in Pd, and taxa richness was significantly lower in Pd than in Pc but not R. These results suggested a decline in richness between Pc and Pd that might be associated with loss of connectivity. Lower Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) richness relative to Odonata, Coleoptera, and Heteroptera (OCH) richness was observed for Pd than R and Pc macrohabitats. Family composition was more similar between R and Pc than between R or Pc and Pd macrohabitats. This similarity may be associated with greater connectivity between R and Pc macrohabitats. Correspondence analysis indicated that macroinvertebrate composition changed along a gradient from R to Pc and Pd that was related to a perennial–intermittent gradient across sites. High variability among macroinvertebrate assemblages in Pd could have been related to variability in the duration of intermittency. In cluster analysis, macroinvertebrate assemblages were grouped by macrohabitat first and then by site, suggesting that the macrohabitat filter had a greater influence on macroinvertebrate assemblages than did local site characteristics. Few taxa were found exclusively in Pc, and this macrohabitat shared numerous taxa with R and Pd, indicating that Pc may act as a bridge between R and Pd during drought. Drought is regarded as a ramp disturbance, but our results suggest that the response of macroinvertebrate assemblages to the loss of hydrological connectivity among macrohabitats is gradual, at least in Mediterranean-climate streams where drying is gradual.

The species is restricted to mountain regions and exhibits an insular distribution across the major mountain ranges. Mitochondrial sequence data (COI) of 254 individuals from the entire species range is analysed to reveal population genetic structure. The data show little molecular variation within populations and regions, but distinct genetic differentiation between mountain ranges. Most populations are significantly differentiated based on F ST and exact tests of population differentiation and most haplotypes are unique to a single mountain range. Phylogenetic analyses reveal deep divergence between geographically isolated lineages. Combined, these results suggest that past fragmentation is the prominent process structuring the populations across Europe. We use tests of selective neutrality and mismatch distributions, to study the demographic population history of regions with haplotype overlap. The high level of genetic differentiation between mountain ranges and estimates of demographic history provide evidence for the existence of multiple glacial refugia, including several in central Europe. The study shows that these aquatic organisms reacted differently to Pleistocene cooling than many terrestrial species. They persisted in numerous refugia over multiple glacial cycles, allowing many local endemic clades to form.",,

Agriculture and associated clay and sandy soils predominated in much of the region. Eighty macroinvertebrate taxa were collected from stream surveys conducted during May and August 1990. Community composition varied primarily by the proportions of Plecoptera and Ephemeroptera. Benthic communities from the heaviest agricultural zones were most different from those at other sites. Chemical composition among the sites varied most in relation to nutrients (NH 3 , NO3, PO 4 ). Other parameters were relatively similar. Physical characteristics of the sites were scored in six habitat categories: (i) substrate characteristics, (ii) instream cover, (iii) channel morphology, (iv) riparian zone and stream‐bank conditions, (v) riffle/run quality, (vi) pool quality. Most physical habitat scores were lowest in the intense agriculture zones. The relative importance of physical and chemical variables in explaining variation in macroinvertebrate communities was quantified using canonical correspondence analysis. Substrate characteristics were most important in both surveys. Significant correlations (P&lt;0.05 and P&lt;0.10) were observed between substrate quality and total numbers of Ephemeropteran, Plecopteran, and Trichopteran taxa. These relationships reflected correlations from sites in the clay soil‐type region (P&lt;0.01 and P&lt;0.10) which contrasted with non‐significant results from the less impacted, sandy soil‐type region. Effective stream restoration efforts in this region will require the alteration of local land‐use activities that influence the physical habitat. Further development of empirical relationships between catchment activities and substrate and channel characteristics within natural geomorphic regions is essential for the evaluation of restoration projects.",,

Citizens are concerned about the quality of water resources and many participate in monitoring activities, though doubts remain about the quality of the data volunteers collect. We trained volunteers to collect benthic macroinvertebrates using professional protocols. Of the seven stream sites sampled by volunteer crews, six sites were also sampled by professional crews. 2. In the laboratory, volunteers used morphological features to identify as many different taxa as possible within the major insect orders; their identification was approximately to family. Volunteers calculated five metrics: total taxon richness, richness of three key groups (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera), and percentage dominance of the three most abundant taxa. All metrics were strongly correlated with (a) the percentage of urbanized area in the catchment and (b) the metrics derived from a more complete taxonomic identification by a professional scientist. Taxon richness metrics declined with urban development, while percent dominance increased. 3. An overall summary multimetric index was used to compare the field and laboratory procedures of volunteers and professionals. Using an ANOVA model, we detected no significant difference between field samples collected by volunteers and professionals. The variance of index values associated with differences between crews was zero. The ability of the index to detect significant differences among sites (statistical power) improved by only 13% for assessments based on professional laboratory identification instead of volunteer laboratory identification. 4. Citizen volunteers, when properly trained, can collect reliable data and make stream assessments that are comparable to those made by professionals. Data collected by volunteers can supplement information used by government agencies to manage and protect rivers and streams.",,

These changes have been linked to altered community composition and declines in biodiversity. Determining the mechanisms driving stream biotic responses, particularly threshold impacts, has, however, proved elusive. To investigate a sediment threshold response by benthic invertebrates, an intensive survey of 30 agricultural streams was conducted along gradients of deposited sediment and dissolved nutrients. Partial redundancy analysis showed that invertebrate community composition changed significantly along the gradient of deposited fine sediment, whereas the effect of dissolved nitrate was weak. Pollution‐sensitive invertebrates (%EPT, Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera) demonstrated a strong nonlinear response to sediment, and change‐point analysis indicated marked declines beyond a threshold of ∼ 20% fine sediment covering the streambed. Structural equation modeling indicated that decreased habitat availability (i.e., coarse substrate and associated interstices) was the key driver affecting pollution‐sensitive invertebrates, with degraded riparian condition controlling resources through direct (e.g., inputs) and indirect (e.g., flow‐mediated) effects on deposited sediment. The identification of specific effects thresholds and the underlying mechanisms (e.g., loss of habitat) driving these changes will assist managers in setting sediment criteria and standards to better guide stream monitoring and rehabilitation.",,

The biomass and species richness of macrophytes and invertebrates in artificial ponds at two sites in southern Sweden (twenty‐one ponds at each site) were investigated. Alkalinity was high at one site (H ponds) and low at the other site (L ponds). The ponds chosen had different densities of signal crayfish ( Pacifastacus leniusculus ), with mean crayfish abundance (estimated by trapping and expressed as catch per unit effort) significantly higher in the L ponds (10.7) than in the H ponds (4.9). Macrophytes, invertebrates, the amount of periphyton on stones and the organic content of the sediment were determined in each pond. 2. Macrophyte biomass, cover and species richness declined with increasing crayfish density. Macrophyte species composition differed between ponds and was related to crayfish abundance. 3. The total biomass of invertebrates and the biomass of herbivorous/detritivorous invertebrates declined with increasing crayfish abundance, but the biomass of predatory invertebrates declined only in the L ponds. The relative biomass of Gastropoda and Odonata declined in ponds where crayfish were abundant. In ponds where crayfish were abundant the invertebrate fauna was dominated by sediment‐dwelling taxa ( Sialis (H and L ponds) and Chironomidae (H ponds)). 4. The number of invertebrate taxa in macrophytes declined with increasing crayfish abundance. The percentage of macrophyte‐associated invertebrate taxa differed between ponds, but also between sites. The relative biomass of Gastropoda declined in H ponds where crayfish were abundant. In H ponds Trichoptera or Gammarus sp. and Heteroptera dominated where crayfish were abundant, whereas Odonata dominated in L ponds with abundant crayfish. 5. The organic content of the sediment decreased in ponds with high crayfish densities, while the amount of periphyton on stones was not related to crayfish density. 6. We conclude that the signal crayfish may play an important role as a keystone consumer in pond ecosystems, but lower trophic levels did not respond to changes in the abundance of the crayfish according to the trophic cascade model. Omnivorous crayfish may decouple the cascading effect.",,

Substrate size preferences were more clearly demonstrated by the comparison of different substrates in the Mohaka River than between runs in the 88 rivers. Taxonomic richness and densities of most collector‐browsers were highest on small cobble‐boulder substrates. However, filterers and a facultative shredder showed strong preferences for large cobbles and boulders and an undescribed orthoclad showed a strong preference for sand. Among the 80 stony‐bedded rivers, those exposed to maximum flows of < 5×, 5–10×, and 10–20× their median flow during 6 weeks before sampling had similar taxonomic richness, densities, and biomass. In contrast, rivers that had experienced maximum flows of > 20× their median flows had markedly lower median taxonomic richness, density, and biomass than less‐flooded rivers.

For most species, no information about their toxicant sensitivity is available. To address this limitation, we have grouped the available information to assign sensitivities to aquatic invertebrate taxa relative to Daphnia magna. With respect to organic compounds, most taxa of the orders Anisoptera, Basommatophora, Coleoptera, Decapoda, Diptera, Ephemeroptera, Eulamellibranchiata, Heteroptera, Hirudinea, Isopoda, Oligochaeta, Prosobranchia, Trichoptera, Tricladida, and Zygoptera are less sensitive than D. magna. Some taxa of the Amphipoda, Plecoptera, and Cladocera (other than D. magna) are significantly more sensitive. For organic compounds, approximately 22% of the investigated taxa were more sensitive than D. magna. Most taxa of the orders Amphipoda, Basommatophora, Diptera, Ephemeroptera, Eulamellibranchiata, Heteroptera, Isopoda, Oligochaeta, and Tricladida are significantly less sensitive than D. magna to metal compounds. The taxa belonging to the Crustacea, with the exception of the order Isopoda, are much more sensitive. For metal compounds, approximately 30% of the investigated taxa were more sensitive than D. magna. Hence, D. magna is among the most sensitive taxa regarding both groups of toxicants. The sensitivities for several taxa are listed, and use of the relative sensitivity distribution to link toxicant effects in mesocosm studies and field investigations is discussed.",,

Shredding invertebrates are widely considered to be of central importance for the breakdown of allochthonous organic material in temperate-zone streams. However, various authors report an absence of this group in tropical streams. Various phenomena, including hydraulic disturbance, chemical leaf quality, and biotic control through macroconsumers, may cause variable shredder performance in streams. Our paper discusses the hypothesis that biogeographic distribution and the life-cycle strategies of the shredders are additional factors affecting the contribution of invertebrates to lotic decomposition processes. As a case study, we analyzed the type of organic matter inputs, the community of benthic invertebrate shredders, and the decomposition of temperate zone leaves (alder, Alnusglutinosa) in the Breitenbach (BRB), a temperate stream in Hesse, Germany, and in the Córrego Tenente Amaral (CTA), a neotropical Cerrado stream in Mato Grosso, Brazil. Quantities of natural leaf-litter inputs were comparable in the 2 systems (CTA: 820 g m−2 y−1, BRB: 700 g m−2 y−1), but the diversity of trees varied from 60 species/ha in CTA to 5 in BRB. Several shredding species were found in CTA, but in very low abundances. Larvae of the shredding calamoceratid caddisfly Phylloicus sp. were found only in lateral pools and not in the stream channel at CTA. Earlier decomposition experiments with naturally fallen native leaves did not indicate any importance of shredders at CTA, but green leaves of A. glutinosa were rapidly consumed by mining chironomids (Stenochironomus sp.). Decomposition rates were faster in CTA (–k = 0.035 ± 0.006) than in BRB during wintertime (0.0095 ± 0.0021). We conclude that detritivorous neotropical insects may have 2 different species traits. Either they have mass occurrences during short periods when their food source is available and they must be adapted to a secondary, permanently available resource on which they can survive for the rest of the time (facultative specialists), or they are restricted to the few sites that provide a permanent food source (localized specialists). Apart from these special cases, however, the community in the neotropical stream was largely composed of omnivores.",,

Eleven taxa of mayflies, 15 taxa of caddisflies, and 10 taxa of stoneflies were collected. All but a few taxa were present at all stations. Benthic insect densities were negatively correlated with increasing discharge and substrate particle movement at all stations. Regression models describing insect density in terms of substrate stability usually accounted for more variation than models describing density in terms of discharge.

With the invasion of rusty crayfish, we found that fishes that share prey taxa with crayfish declined in numbers over time, but piscivorous fish species did not change in abundance. Snails declined from &gt;10 000 to &lt;5 snails·m 2 in one of the first invaded areas. Mean abundance of Odonata, Amphipoda, and Trichoptera decreased significantly lake-wide. Resident crayfish species nearly disappeared, although total crayfish abundance, driven by high abundances of rusty crayfish, continued to rise. Submerged macrophyte species richness declined by as much as 80% at some locations. Together these responses demonstrate dramatic long-term changes in the littoral zone biota of Trout Lake. Continued invasions of similar lakes in the region suggest that these impacts are occurring on a region-wide basis with potentially irreversible effects on communities and ecosystems. Only through long-term natural experiments such as this study can researchers ascertain the full extent of invasions and their impacts on community and ecosystem process that respond at spatial and temporal scales not captured in mesocosm studies.",,

The responses represented an estimated 13,000–15,000 samples collected and processed per year. Kicknet devices were used in 64.5% of the methods; other sampling devices included fixed-area samplers (Surber and Hess), artificial substrates (Hester–Dendy and rock baskets), grabs, and dipnets. Regional differences existed, e.g., the 1-m kicknet was used more often in the eastern US than in the western US. Mesh sizes varied among programs but 80.2% of the methods used a mesh size between 500 and 600 μm. Mesh size variations within US Environmental Protection Agency regions were large, with size differences ranging from 100 to 700 μm. Most samples collected were composites; the mean area sampled was 1.7 m2. Samples rarely were collected using a random method (4.7%); most samples (70.6%) were collected using ""expert opinion"", which may make data obtained operator-specific. Only 26.3% of the methods sorted all the organisms from a sample; the remainder subsampled in the laboratory. The most common method of subsampling was to remove 100 organisms (range = 100–550). The magnification used for sorting ranged from 1 (sorting by eye) to 30×, which results in inconsistent separation of macroinvertebrates from detritus. In addition to subsampling, 53% of the methods sorted large/rare organisms from a sample. The taxonomic level used for identifying organisms varied among taxa; Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera were generally identified to a finer taxonomic resolution (genus and species) than other taxa. Because there currently exists a large range of field and laboratory methods used by state programs, calibration among all programs to increase data comparability would be exceptionally challenging. However, because many techniques are shared among methods, limited testing could be designed to evaluate whether procedural differences affect the ability to determine levels of environmental impairment using benthic macroinvertebrate communities.",,

Emergence and inland dispersal of adult stoneflies (Plecoptera) and caddisflies (Trichoptera) from Broadstone Stream, an acidic and iron‐rich stream in southern England, were studied over 10 months in 1996–1997. Fifteen pyramidal emergence traps were placed randomly in a 200‐m stretch. Three Malaise traps were placed above the stream and six more on each side (one wooded, one open) along a transect at distances of 1, 15, 30, 45, 60 and 75 m from the channel. 2. More than 16 000 stoneflies, belonging to 11 species, and just under 400 caddisflies (22 species) were caught. Four dominant stoneflies ( Leuctra fusca , Leuctra nigra , Leuctra hippopus and Nemurella pictetii ) accounted for 96% and 95% of the catches in the emergence and Malaise traps, respectively. Two caddisflies ( Plectrocnemia conspersa and Potamophylax cingulatus ) accounted for 63% of the catch in the Malaise traps. Few caddisflies were taken in emergence traps. 3. The emergence periods of L. fusca , L. nigra and L. hippopus were well‐defined and unimodal, whereas that of N. pictetii was prolonged and erratic. Overall, more females (1285) emerged than males (740). 4. Female stoneflies and caddisflies were in the majority in the Malaise traps above the stream. On land, significantly more females than males of L. fusca, L. nigra and P. cingulatus were caught. The sex ratio of the remaining species did not deviate significantly from 1:1. 5. The three Malaise traps placed above the stream caught most of the stoneflies though there was also dispersal away from the channel, the numbers caught declining with distance. Exponential models explained between 67% and 99% of the variation in numbers of individuals with distance from the channel in the four common stoneflies. Half the individuals went less than 11–16 m from the stream, while 90% travelled less than 51 m. Significantly more L. nigra and N. pictetii were caught in the woodland than on the open side, whereas L. hippopus showed no overall preference for either side.",,

Using this model, we assessed group-size-related predation risk in pupae of the stream-dwelling trichopteran Rhyacophila vao from the planarian predator Polycelis coronata. When considered on its own, Rhyacophila pupal aggregation conferred an apparent disadvantage from encounter-related effects, since both predator-encounter probabilities and local densities increased in a density-dependent manner with pupal group size. In contrast, dilution effects related to the functional response of Polycelis yielded group-size-related benefits. When their combined (i.e., attack-abatement) effect was considered, aggregation was found to confer a net fitness advantage to pupae by decreasing predation hazard, primarily from the benefits of predator dilution not being entirely swamped by the potentially deleterious encounter effects. Furthermore, assessment of these relationships at different spatial scales helped elucidate some of the underlying proximal biological mechanisms involved. This study shows how the separate consideration of predator-encounter and dilution effects can provide an incomplete depiction of the effectiveness of grouping as an antipredator defense and emphasizes the importance of assessing their combined, attack-abatement effect.",,

Changes in benthic invertebrate community structure following 16 years of forest succession after logging were examined by estimating benthic invertebrate abundance, biomass and secondary production in streams draining a forested reference and a recovering clear‐cut catchment. Benthic invertebrate abundance was three times higher, and invertebrate biomass and production were two times higher in the disturbed stream. 2. Comparison of invertebrate community abundance 1, 5 and 16 years after clear‐cutting indicated that the proportion of scrapers had decreased, whereas shredders had increased. Functional group percentage similarity indicated that the invertebrate community in the disturbed stream 16 years after clear‐cutting was more similar to the reference than to that found earlier in the disturbed stream. 3. The five indices calculated from data collected over the past 16 years, as well as the abundance, biomass and production data collected during this study, proved to be of differing value in assessing recovery of the disturbed stream from logging. Percent dominant taxon and EPT (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera) taxon richness failed to show any initial differences between reference and disturbed streams, indicating that these indices may not be useful for measuring recovery from logging. The percentage Baetis and shredder–scraper indices showed significant differences only during the 1977 study and suggest recovery (no difference between reference and disturbed) by 1982. The North Carolina Biotic Index showed continued differences during 1982 in the riffle and depositional habitats and recovery by 1993. Total macroinvertebrate abundance, biomass and production, as well as EPT abundance, indicated continued differences between the reference and disturbed streams in the 1993 study.",,

The feeding preferences of the trichopteran shredder Sericostoma personatum Spence and the amphipod shredder Gammarus pulex L. were studied using specimens collected in a springbrook where the major food source was beech litter ( Fagus sylvatica L.). Six food items were tested: conditioned beech leaves, conditioned alder leaves ( Alnus glutinosa L.), conditioned Sitka spruce needles [ Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr], fresh beech leaves, a fresh macrophyte ( Potamogeton perfoliatus L.) and a fresh filamentous green alga ( Microspora sp.). 2. The overall preference pattern shown by the two shredders was the same: both preferred conditioned Alnus most, followed by fresh Microspora . The least preferred food items were conditioned Fagus leaves and Picea needles. 3. The feeding preference of the two shredders proved to be unrelated to food source fibre content, toughness, total phosphorus, C:N ratio and total nitrogen ( P &gt;0.05). 4. Despite the overall similarity in their feeding preferences, Gammarus was more selective than Sericostoma . The reason for this difference is discussed. 5. We interpret our findings as indicating that detritivore‐shredders do not per se prefer leaf litter, but in fact actively select other food items such as filamentous green algae or macrophytes, even when terrestrial leaf litter is abundant. Most shredders in Danish forest streams thus seem to live on a growth‐limiting food resource that they do not prefer. This may have important implications for secondary production in such streams.",,

They are distributed unevenly; with the greatest number and density occurring in the Oriental Biogeographic Region and the smallest in the East Palearctic. Ecosystem services provided by Trichoptera are also very diverse and include their essential roles in food webs, in biological monitoring of water quality, as food for fish and other predators (many of which are of human concern), and as engineers that stabilize gravel bed sediment. They are especially important in capturing and using a wide variety of nutrients in many forms, transforming them for use by other organisms in freshwaters and surrounding riparian areas. The general pattern of evolution for trichopteran families is becoming clearer as more genes from more taxa are sequenced and as morphological characters are becoming understood in greater detail. This increasingly credible phylogeny provides a foundation for interpreting and hypothesizing the functional traits of this diverse order of freshwater organisms and for understanding the richness of the ecological services corresponding with those traits. Our research also is gaining insight into the timing of evolutionary diversification in the order. Correlations for the use of angiosperm plant material as food and case construction material by the earliest ancestors of infraorder Plenitentoria—by at least 175 Ma—may provide insight into the timing of the origin of angiosperms.",,

By replicated monthly sampling, substrate particle size distributions, current velocity, standing crops of benthic organic matter, and production of macrofauna were measured in each of three principal habitats: bedrock—outcrop, riffle, and pool. Samples were taken at randomly assigned locations and the relative number of samples taken from each habitat was assumed to be proportional to the area of the habitat within the stream. These proportions were used to weight production measured in each habitat and the resulting values were summed to obtain production per unit area of average stream bed. The bedrock—outcrop habitat was characterized by high material entertainment and export as indicated by significantly higher current velocities and lower standing crops of detritus compared to the riffle and pool habitats. Pools were sites of low entertainment and high retention of organic matter as demonstrated by significantly lower current velocities and higher accumulations of detritus than other habitats. The riffle habitat was intermediate to the bedrock—outcrop and pool habitats in all parameters measured. Annual production of collector—filterers was highest in the bedrock—outcrop (ash—free dry mass 1920 mg/m 2 ), followed by riffle (278 mg/m 2 ) and pool (32 mg/m 2 ). Although constituting only 19% of the stream area, the bedrock—outcrop habitat contributed 68% of the habitat—weighted collector—filterer production. Annual production of shredders was highest in pools (2616 mg/m 2 ), followed by riffles (1657 mg/m 2 ) and bedrock—outcrop (579 mg/m 2 ). The pool habitat, constituting 23% of stream area, contributed 36% of shredder production. Annual production of scrapers was highest in the riffle habitat (905 mg/m 2 ), followed by bedrock—outcrop (517—mg/m 2 ) and pool (238 mg/m 2 ). Riffles constituted 58% of total stream area and were the source of 77% of the habitat—weighted scraper production. Annual production of engulfing predators was greatest in the pool habitat (2313 mg/m 2 ), followed by riffles (1765 mg/m 2 ) and bedrock—outcrop (687 mg/m 2 ). The relatively lower production of engulfing predators in the bedrock—outcrop habitat reflects a functional shift in mode of resource acquisition by predators, with predaceous collector—filterers (Arcto—psychinae: Trichoptera) predominating in the bedrock—outcrop. Collector—gatherer production was more evenly distributed, with the bedrock—outcrop, riffle, and pool habitats each contributing 14, 54, and 33% to the habitat—weighted production, respectively. Unlike all other functional groups, this distribution was not significantly different from the distribution of stream area among habitats and reflected lack of dependence on specific physical attributes of the local environment for access to food by members of this functional group. Local geomorphology determined the diversity and spatial distribution of bedrock—outcrops, riffles, and pools in the study stream. In turn, the functional structure of the macrofauna, when viewed holistically, was the result of the integration of the relative contributions of each habitat type of total stream area. Total habitat—weighted annual production in the study stream was estimated at 5093 and 1921 mg/m 2 for primary and secondary consumers, respectively. The distribution of habitat—weighted production among functional groups was: collector—gatherers (39%), followed by shredders (225), engulfing predators (22%), scrapers (13%), and collector—filterers (8%). This functional structure agrees favorably with current conceptual models of head water streams draining forested catchments.",,

The model was tested for the total abundance of invertebrates and for the abundances of Chironomidae, Cladocera, Cyclopoida, Gastropoda, Hydracarina, Ostracoda and Trichoptera. 2.

Production was dominated by three net-spinning taxa (Cheumatopsyche spp., Hydropsyche rossi, and Chimarra moselyi), comprising 97–98% of the total among at least 14 trichopteran species. Annual production (as dry mass) was among the highest estimates reported for caddisflies, ranging from 43.5 to 63.9 g/m2 of snag surface (or from 14.2 to 25.5 g/m2 of channel bottom) in two consecutive years. Although all taxa were present throughout the year, C. moselyi had much higher production in summer, H. rossi was highest from late summer to winter, and Cheumatopsyche spp. showed no pattern. Ingestion was determined from production estimates, bioenergetic efficiencies, and quantitative gut analyses. The two macrofiltering taxa (Cheumatopsyche spp. and H. rossi) were omnivorous, with 50.6 and 64.4% of their production, respectively, due to eating animals. Somewhat lower amounts of their production (40.7 and 23.5%) were due to ingestion of amorphous detritus. Production of the microfiltering species Chimarra moselyi was primarily due to eating amorphous detritus (91%). Removal of amorphous detritus from the system by the major taxa was highest in summer, and diatom removal was highest in fall, whereas animals were eaten consistently throughout the year. A quantitative food web showed that while the linkages among nine taxa were complex, the ingestion pathways were dominated by amorphous detritus (total consumption = 62.5 g·m−2·yr−1) and animal prey (22.3 g·m−2·yr−1), with >99% of food resources being consumed by the three dominant filter-feeding taxa. A connectivity food web was misleading because it implied equivalence of all food resources and consumers when great variation in strength of linkages actually existed. These comparisons provide a strong argument for considering energy flow as a measure of linkage strength when evaluating food webs, and they cast doubt on the usefulness of oversimplified connectivity webs as a basis for food web theory.",,

Insects vary considerably between and within orders, and even within the same genus, in the degree to which the female's lifetime potential egg complement is mature when she emerges as an adult. 2. The ‘ovigeny index’ (OI) – the number of eggs females have ready to lay divided by the lifetime potential fecundity – quantifies variation in the degree of early life concentration of egg production, and also variation in initial reproductive effort. 3. Here, an integrated set of hypotheses is presented, based on a conceptual model of resource allocation and acquisition, concerning trade‐offs at the interspecific level between initial investment in egg production (as measured by OI) and other life‐history traits in holometabolous insects. 4. The evidence supporting each of these hypotheses is reviewed, and particular attention is paid to the Lepidoptera, as relevant life‐history data are rapidly accumulating for this ecologically and economically important group. 5. There is evidence at the interspecific level supporting: (i) a link between OI and a trade‐off between soma and non‐soma in Trichoptera and Hymenoptera (the proportionate allocation to soma decreases with increasing OI); (ii) a negative correlation between OI and dependency on external nutrient inputs (via adult feeding) in Hymenoptera and in Lepidoptera; (iii) a negative correlation between OI and the degree of polyandry (and nuptial gift, i.e. spermatophore, use) in Lepidoptera; (iv) negative correlations between OI and resource re‐allocation capabilities (egg and thoracic musculature resorption) in Hymenoptera and in Lepidoptera; (v) a negative correlation between lifespan and OI in Trichoptera, Hymenoptera, and Lepidoptera, indicating a cost of reproduction; (vi) a link between winglessness and an OI of one in Lepidoptera; (vii) a negative correlation between OI and the degree of female mobility in winged Lepidoptera; and (viii) a negative correlation between OI and larval diet breadth (as mediated by oviposition strategy) in Lepidoptera.",,

Physiological traits related to Cd bioaccumulation, compartmentalization, and ultimately susceptibility were measured in 21 aquatic insect species representing the orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera. We mapped these experimentally derived physiological traits onto a phylogeny and quantified the tendency for related species to be similar (phylogenetic signal). All traits related to Cd bioaccumulation and susceptibility exhibited statistically significant phylogenetic signal, although the signal strength varied among traits. Conventional and phylogenetically based regression models were compared, revealing great variability within orders but consistent, strong differences among insect families. Uptake and elimination rate constants were positively correlated among species, but only when effects of body size and phylogeny were incorporated in the analysis. Together, uptake and elimination rates predicted dramatic Cd bioaccumulation differences among species that agreed with field-based measurements. We discovered a potential tradeoff between the ability to eliminate Cd and the ability to detoxify it across species, particularly mayflies. The best-fit regression models were driven by phylogenetic parameters (especially differences among families) rather than functional traits, suggesting that it may eventually be possible to predict a taxon's physiological performance based on its phylogenetic position, provided adequate physiological information is available for close relatives.

The purpose of our study was to document changes in channel form and macroinvertebrate assemblages following the removal of a low-head, run-of-river dam from the Baraboo River, Wisconsin, in January 2000. We surveyed cross sections and collected benthic macroinvertebrate samples in 6 reaches (an upstream reference reach, reaches immediately above and below the dam that was to be removed, and sequential unimpounded and impounded reaches further downstream) in a multiple-dam system. Surveys were conducted in December 1999, before dam removal, in March 2000 immediately after dam removal, and in August 2000 following a flood. Benthic sediments were collected from selected sites in March and August to measure particle size shifts associated with the dam breach. Before dam removal, impounded reaches were characterized by relatively deep, wide channels, extensive deposits of loose sediments, and macroinvertebrate taxa characteristic of lentic or depositional habitats. Removal of the dam significantly decreased the cross-sectional area of the active channel in the former impoundment from 59 m<sup>2</sup> to 11 m<sup>2</sup>, but did not alter channel form in downstream reaches. However, we found an increase in loose sediments and in the relative abundance of the sand fraction (0.5-2.0 mm) below the dam immediately after it had been removed. A flood in June increased cross-sectional area in the former impoundment by widening the channel. Sediments that had settled in the reaches below the dam in March were transported ∼3.5 km downstream, where they became trapped in another impoundment. The flood had little or no detectable effect on the other 5 study reaches. Within 1 y of dam removal, macroinvertebrate assemblages in formerly impounded reaches did not significantly differ from those in either the upstream reference site or in other unimpounded reaches below the dam site. All unimpounded sites were characterized by lotic taxa such as net-spinning caddisflies and heptageniid mayflies regardless of their impoundment history. Thus, dam removal caused relatively small and transient geomorphic and ecological changes in downstream reaches, and apparently rapid channel development to an equilibrium form within the impoundment, associated with both dam removal and the subsequent June flood. These muted changes and rapid recovery likely result from the relatively large channel size and the small volume of stored sediment available for transport following dam removal.",,

We intensively sampled 16 western Oregon streams to characterize: (1) the variability in macroinvertebrate assemblages at seven spatial scales; and (2) the change in taxon richness with increasing sampling effort. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) model calculated spatial variance components for taxon richness, total density, percent individuals of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT), percent dominance and Shannon diversity. 2. At the landscape level, ecoregion and among-streams components dominated variance for most metrics, accounting for 43–72% of total variance. However, ecoregion accounted for very little variance in total density and 36% of the variance was attributable to differences between streams. For other metrics, variance components were more evenly divided between stream and ecoregion effects. 3. Within streams, approximately 70% of variance was associated with unstructured local spatial variation and not associated with habitat type or transect position. The remaining variance was typically split about evenly between habitat and transect. Sample position within a transect (left, centre or right) accounted for virtually none of the variance for any metric. 4. New taxa per stream increased rapidly with sampling effort with the first four to eight Surber samples (500–1000 individuals counted), then increased more gradually. After counting more than 50 samples, new taxa continued to be added in stream reaches that were 80 times as long as their mean wetted width. Thus taxon richness was highly dependent on sampling effort, and comparisons between sites or streams must be normalized for sampling effort. 5. Characterization of spatial variance structure is fundamental to designing sampling programmes where spatial comparisons range from local to regional scales. Differences in metric responses across spatial scales demonstrate the importance of designing sampling strategies and analyses capable of discerning differences at the scale of interest.",,

At log addition transects, stream depth increased, current velocity decreased, cobble substratum was covered by sand and silt, and both coarse and fine particulate organic matter increased dramatically. Log additions had less dramatic effects on uptake lengths of ammonium, nitrate, and phosphate, but they had immediate and significant impacts on invertebrate community structure: abundances and biomass of scrapers and filterers decreased; collectors and predators increased; overall shredder biomass did not change, but biomass of trichopteran and dipteran shredders increased, while that of most plecopteran shredders decreased; and plecopteran predators also decreased despite greater abundances of potential prey. These observations suggest that physiological and morpho-behavioral constraints preclude many animals from tracking resources among patches when patches display very different abiotic conditions. Secondary production of scrapers and filterers decreased, whereas that of collectors and predators increased. The shifts in functional group abundances, biomass, and production between reference and debris-dam transects, which differed considerably from those previously reported for low-gradient, sandy-bottom streams, accentuate the importance of localized abiotic factors in structuring invertebrate communities within patches.",,

The aim of this paper is to examine the relative importance of area and habitat heterogeneity in determining species richness in nature reserves. Specifically, the work tests the hypothesis that species–area relationships are not positive if habitat heterogeneity does not increase with area. Location Sixteen nature reserves (area range 89–11,030 ha) in central Hungary. Methods Four‐year faunistic inventories were conducted in the reserves involving c . 70 fieldworkers and 65 taxonomists. CORINE 50,000 land‐cover maps were used for calculating the heterogeneity of the reserve landscape (number of habitat types, number of habitat patches and total length of edges). Results Large reserves were less heterogeneous than small reserves, probably because large reserves were established in large blocks of unproductive land whereas small reserves tended to be in more fertile land. In total, 3975 arthropod species were included in the analysis. The slope of the species–area relationship was positive only for Neuroptera and Trichoptera. There was no significant relationship in the other nine taxa examined (Collembola, Acari, Orthoptera, Thysanoptera, Coleoptera, Araneae, Diplopoda, Chilopoda, Diptera). The density (number of species ha −1 ) of all species, however, showed a positive correlation with heterogeneity. Main conclusions The general lack of fit of species–area relationships in this study is inconsistent with most previous published studies. Importantly, and unlike many other studies, habitat heterogeneity was not correlated with reserve area in the studied system. In the absence of this source of covariation, stronger relationships were identified that suggested a fundamental link between species richness and habitat heterogeneity. The results indicate that habitat heterogeneity rather than area per se is the most important predictor of species richness in the studied system.",,

Stream managers need to understand relationships between multiple stressors and ecological responses. We examined responses of benthic invertebrates and algae along two land-use-related stressor gradients of concern in running waters. Our correlative study of the consequences of augmented deposited fine sediment and nutrient concentrations was conducted in a regional set of streams and rivers monitored by a water management authority in New Zealand and incorporated a wide range of catchment geologies and stream orders. 2. We used multiple linear regression analysis and an information-theoretic approach to select the best predictive models for our biological response variables by testing multiple competing hypotheses that include nonlinear subsidy-stress relationships and interactive effects between the two stressors. 3. Patterns consistent with a subsidy-stress response to increasing dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentration were found for the relative abundances of the common invertebrate genera Pycnocentrodes and Deleatidium and for the relative abundance of total individuals in the EPT orders (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera). 4. Fine sediment seemed the more pervasive stressor, apparently counteracting and overwhelming any initial subsidy effect of increased nutrients, and accounting for more of the variance in biological response variables. Relationships with high nutrient concentrations were weaker and modelled with less certainty, probably reflecting the indirect modes of action of nutrients compared to those underlying sediment effects. Nevertheless, in several cases, the models indicated that nutrients interacted synergistically with fine sediment, lending further weight to the conclusion that managers need to address both stressors to achieve the best outcomes.",,

The impact of agricultural activities on waterways is a global issue, but the magnitude of the problem is often not clearly recognized by landowners, and land and water management agencies. 2. The Pomahaka River in southern New Zealand represents a typical lowland catchment with a long history of agricultural development. Fifteen sites were sampled along a 119‐km stretch of the river. Headwater sites were surrounded by low‐intensity sheep farming, with high‐intensity pasture and dairying occurring in the mid‐reach and lower reaches. 3. Water clarity decreased significantly from about 6 m in the headwaters to less than 2 m in the lower reaches. Benthic sediment levels increased significantly downriver, peaking at 35 mg m −−2 below several tributaries with high‐intensity agriculture in their catchments. Periphyton levels were also significantly greater in the lower reaches than the headwaters, and coincided with increased nitrogen (DIN) and phosphorus (SRP) concentrations. 4. Macro‐invertebrate species richness did not change significantly throughout the river, but species composition did with Ephemeroptera, and to a lesser extent, Plecoptera and Trichoptera dominating the headwater sites (where there was high water clarity, and low nutrient and periphyton levels). Downriver these assemblages were replaced by molluscs, oligochaetes and chironomids. 5. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that agricultural intensity and physical conditions associated with agriculture activity (e.g. impacted waters, high turbidity and temperature) were strongly associated with the composition of benthic assemblages at differing reaches down the Pomahaka River. 6. The present results indicate that quantifying agricultural intensity within a catchment, particularly relative livestock densities, may provide a useful tool for identifying threshold levels above which river health declines.",,

For many decades, diversity patterns in riverine ecosystems were thought to be related to local environmental conditions. Recent theoretical work, however, suggests that diversity in rivers is strongly affected by dispersal along the dendritic landscape structure and that environmental conditions are intrinsically linked to the network position. In this study we tested hypotheses on network position by relating river network geometry and connectivity to multi‐level biodiversity patterns across large scales. Location Three major alpine drainage basins in Switzerland were studied (Rhine, Rhone, Ticino), extending over an elevational gradient of &gt; 2500 m and covering a total area of 41,285 km 2 . Methods We sampled all may‐, stone‐ and caddisfly species at 217 sites which representatively cover the three river networks. Using generalized additive models, we related diversity patterns in aquatic insects to centrality within the network as a direct river network property, and to catchment area and elevation, which are related to network position. Results Centrality within the river network, and catchment area and elevation had significant and interacting effects on α‐diversity and community similarity. Alpha diversity was lowest in peripheral headwaters and at high elevations. Species richness generally increased with increasing catchment area. Well‐connected, central communities within the river network had greater α‐diversity than more peripheral communities did. Elevation was a strong predictor of α‐diversity, with the most diverse communities found at mid‐elevation sites. Community similarity decreased with increasing along‐stream distance between sites. Main conclusions Our results highlight the fact that diversity patterns of aquatic insects in river systems are related to local factors such as elevation, but interact with network properties and connectivity along waterways, and differ among insect orders. These findings are consistent with dispersal‐limited processes and indicate that riverine diversity should be addressed and protected taking the river network structure into account.",,

Originally a Z/ZZ (female/male) system, it evolved by chromosome rearrangement to a WZ/ZZ (female/male) system in the most species-rich branch of Lepidoptera, a monophyletic group consisting of Ditrysia and Tischeriina, which together comprise more than 98% of all species. Further sporadic rearrangements created multi-sex chromosome systems; sporadic losses of the W changed the system formally back to Z/ZZ in some species. Primary sex determination depends on a Z-counting mechanism in Z/ZZ species, but on a female-determining gene, &lt;i&gt;Fem, &lt;/i&gt;in the W chromosome of the silkworm. The molecular mechanism is unknown in both cases. The silkworm shares the last step, &lt;i&gt;dsx, &lt;/i&gt;of the hierarchical sex-determining pathway with &lt;i&gt;Drosophila &lt;/i&gt;and other insects investigated, but probably not the intermediate steps between the primary signal and &lt;i&gt;dsx. &lt;/i&gt;The W chromosome is heterochromatic in most species. It contains few genes and is flooded with interspersed repetitive elements. In interphase nuclei of females it is readily discernible as a heterochromatic body which grows with increasing degree of polyploidy in somatic cells. It is used as a marker for the genetic sex in studies of intersexes and &lt;i&gt;Wolbachia &lt;/i&gt;infections. The sex chromosome system is being exploited in economically important species. Special strains have been devised for mass rearing of male-only broods in the silkworm for higher silk production and in pest species for the release of sterile males in pest management programs.",,

These effects of insecticides were distinguished from the hydraulic stress also associated with surface runoff. Transient increase in discharge and insecticide contamination (maximum 6 μg/L parathion-ethyl in stream water, 302 μg/L fenvalerate in suspended particulates) was observed in a headwater stream subsequent to surface runoff from arable land. In the aquatic macroinvertebrate community, eight of the eleven abundant species disappeared, and the remaining three were reduced significantly in abundance following the insecticide-contaminated runoff. Recovery within 6 months was observed for four species and recovery within 11 months for nine species. Two species remained at a low population density for over a year. The effects of insecticides were distinguished from other parameters, such as hydraulic stress associated with surface runoff, as well. The causal connection between insecticide contamination and biological response was established by eliminating increased hydraulic stress during surface runoff using in-parallel bypass microcosms containing the dominant species Gammarus pulex and Limnephilus lunatus. The mortality of these species was similar to that of the same species in the stream. Additional microcosms, disconnected from the stream during runoff events, served as a control. Thus, the toxic potential of the runoff water is considered to be responsible for the observed effect on the macroinvertebrates.

Macroinvertebrates were sampled from three habitats at forty‐five sites in the catchment of the Welsh River Wye. Species assemblages were ordinated by DECORANA. classified by TWIN‐SPAN and related to physico‐chemical factors using correlation and multiple discriminant analysis respectively. 2. DECORANA axis 1 was correlated with pH or total hardness, whilst axis 2 correlated with slope or distance from source. TWINSPAN groupings were also related to hardness and, to a lesser extent, slope. Assemblages at soft‐water sites (&lt;15gm −3 CaCO 3 ) were composed mostly of Plecoptera but at hard‐water sites, even at high slope (&gt;10 m km −1 ), the fauna was dominated numerically by Ephemerop‐tera, net‐spinning Trichoptera, Mollusca and Crustacea. 3. We suggest that our data do not support the River Continuum Concept unless there are modifications to allow for multiple gradients.",,

For example, in some orders such as Hymenoptera, all members are haplodiploid, whereas Diptera contain species with homomorphic as well as male and female heterogametic sex chromosome systems or paternal genome elimination. We have established a large database on karyotypes and sex chromosomes in insects, containing information on over 13000 species covering 29 orders of insects. This database constitutes a unique starting point to report phylogenetic patterns on the distribution of sex determination mechanisms, sex chromosomes, and karyotypes among insects and allows us to test general theories on the evolutionary dynamics of karyotypes, sex chromosomes, and sex determination systems in a comparative framework. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that male heterogamety is the ancestral mode of sex determination in insects, and transitions to female heterogamety are extremely rare. Many insect orders harbor species with complex sex chromosomes, and gains and losses of the sex-limited chromosome are frequent in some groups. Haplodiploidy originated several times within insects, and parthenogenesis is rare but evolves frequently. Providing a single source to electronically access data previously distributed among more than 500 articles and books will not only accelerate analyses of the assembled data, but also provide a unique resource to guide research on which taxa are likely to be informative to address specific questions, for example, for genome sequencing projects or large-scale comparative studies.",,

Twenty to 24 sampling sites in each stream were selected based on similarities of substrate particle-size distributions, depths, and current velocities but for differences in amounts of deposited sediment, which ranged from 0 to 100% surface cover. Deposited sediment was quantified 2 ways: a visual estimate of % surface cover, and a measurement of substrate embeddedness, which were highly correlated with each other and with the amount of sand. Invertebrates were collected using a kicknet for a specified time in a 1-m2 area. Five commonly used biomonitoring metrics (taxa richness, density, Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera [EPT] richness, EPT density, and EPT/Chironomidae richness) were consistently significantly correlated across streams to deposited sediment. Shannon diversity index, Chironomidae richness, Chironomidae density, a biotic index, and % dominant taxon did not relate to increasing levels of deposited sediment. Tolerance values representing taxa responses to deposited sediment were developed for 30 taxa. Deposited-sediment tolerance values were not correlated with biotic index tolerance values, indicating a different response by taxa to deposited sediment than to organic enrichment. Deposited-sediment tolerance values were used to develop the Deposited Sediment Biotic Index (DSBI). The DSBI was calculated for all samples (n = 85) to characterize sediment impairment of the sampled streams. DSBI values for each site were highly correlated with measures of deposited sediment. Model validation by a resampling procedure confirmed that the DSBI is a potentially useful tool for assessing ecological effects of deposited sediment.",,

A field experiment was conducted at the Fernow Experimental Forest in West Virginia to examine the effects of fine sediment on macroinvertebrate assemblages. Fine sediment (<2 mm) was varied between 0 and 30% in 5% increments in otherwise natural substratum mixtures in 0.03-m<sup>2</sup> trays deployed at each of 3 sites along Elklick Run, a 4th-order stream, and allowed to colonize for 5 wk. Macroinvertebrate density (-, sign indicates response to fine sediment), biomass (-), EPT (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera) taxa richness (-), the proportion of Ephemeroptera composed of Baetidae (+), and the proportion of chironomids composed of Chironominae (-) and of Orthocladiinae (+) were the most sensitive and reliable metrics. Sediment effects on metrics were generally subtle, even when statistically significant. Ordination and the relative abundance of individual taxa indicated that assemblage structure was altered by treatment, but the shift was generally less than the variation in structure among the 3 sites. Percent organic matter and interstitial velocity were quantified, but did not appear to explain observed responses to treatment. Comparison of assemblages colonizing treatment mixtures with assemblages colonizing natural substratum indicated that most aspects of the experiment were realistic. Macroinvertebrate assemblages were also sampled in 15 local streams, which varied in fine-sediment bed loads, to determine if predictions based on the field experiment were supported at a larger spatial scale. Survey results generally agreed qualitatively with experimental results suggesting that some metrics were robust at a regional scale for physically and geologically similar streams.",,

Field experiments were conducted to examine the impact of grazing invertebrates on periphyton biomass in twenty‐one pools across three northern California coastal streams (U.S.A.): Big Sulphur Creek, the Rice Fork of the Eel River, and Big Canyon Creek. Periphyton accrual on artificial substrate tiles was compared in each stream between two treatments: those elevated slightly above the stream bottom to reduce access by grazers (= platforms) and those placed directly on the stream bottom to allow access by grazers (=controls). 2. Crawling invertebrate grazers (cased caddisflies and snails) were numerically dominant in each stream (86% of all grazers in Big Sulphur Creek, 61% in the Rice Fork, 84% in Big Canyon Creek). Platforms effectively excluded crawling grazers, but were less effective in excluding swimming mayfly grazers (Baetidae). 3. Periphyton biomass (as AFDM) on tiles was significantly lower on controls compared to platforms for the Rice Fork, an open‐canopy stream, and Big Sulphur Creek, a stream with a heterogeneous canopy. In contrast, no grazer impact was found for Big Canyon Creek, a densely shaded stream. Here, extremely low periphyton biomass occurred for both treatments throughout the 60 day study. 4. The influence of riparian canopy on periphyton growth (i.e. accrual on platforms), grazer impact on periphyton, and grazer abundance was examined for Big Sulphur Creek. As canopy increased (15–98% cover), periphyton biomass on platforms decreased. In contrast, canopy had little influence on periphyton accrual on controls; apparently, grazers could maintain low periphyton standing crops across the full range of canopy levels. The abundance of one grazer species, the caddisfly Gumaga nigricula , was highest in open, sunlit stream pools; abundance of two other prominent grazers, Helicopsyche borealis (Trichoptera) and Centroptilum convexum (Ephemeroptera), however, was unrelated to canopy.",,

Hemigrammus marginatus, Roeboides paranensis, Hyphessobrycon eques, Astyanax altiparanae, Serrasalmus spilopleura, and Bryconamericus stramineus were predominantly invertivores, with predominance of aquatic insects (Diptera, Ephemeroptera, and Trichoptera immatures) among their food items. The predominantly algivores were Apareiodon affinis, Serrapinnus notomelas, and Satanoperca pappaterra, with high frequency of filamentous blue-green algae, diatoms, clorophyts, and periderm. The different microhabitat exploitation plus diet composition suggests partitioning of resources and absence of food competition among the most representative fish species in the studied community, indicating the importance of the naturalistic approach to fish ecology studies.",,

Degradation of freshwater ecosystems is a major concern worldwide. Agriculture introduces multiple stressors to streams, presenting a challenge for freshwater managers who must understand the relative strengths of individual stressor effects and their combined multiple‐stressor effects. 2. Using a replicated regression design, we manipulated levels of fine sediment and nutrients to create a broad eight‐point gradient for each stressor across 128 stream mesocosms to determine the shapes of macroinvertebrate responses after 21 days of exposure. 3. Subsidy–stress response patterns occurred along both stressor gradients. Sediment addition provided an initial subsidy for some pollution‐tolerant taxa and total macroinvertebrate density, but produced consistently negative effects for other taxa, total taxon richness and the density and richness of pollution‐sensitive Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera (EPT) taxa. Nutrient enrichment provided an initial subsidy for densities of two common EPT taxa, total EPT density, macroinvertebrate and EPT taxon richness. 4. Few macroinvertebrate variables were affected by a single stressor (always fine sediment). The majority of responses were additive multiple‐stressor patterns, although Chironomidae density and EPT taxon richness followed complex synergistic patterns. 5. Fine sediment was a much more pervasive stressor than augmented nutrient concentrations. Overall, macroinvertebrate traits responded to stressors as strongly as community variables or individual taxa. 6. Synthesis and applications . Managing both fine sediment and nutrient inputs from agriculture is crucial to achieve good stream condition but priority should be given to minimizing fine sediment, which should be maintained below a threshold of 5% cover and 0·5‐mm depth. Managers also need to be wary of interactive multiple‐stressor effects because ecological outcomes of an increase in stressor load may be worse than predicted based on the knowledge of single‐stressor effects.",,

To address this shortcoming, we compiled data from 495 published estimates of local genera richness for three orders of stream‐dwelling insects (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera) from throughout the world and used these data to describe global geographic patterns in stream insect genera richness and to address two questions: 1) does local stream insect richness vary more with regional historical factors or with local ecological factors?, and 2) to what extent have streams converged in the number of taxa they support? Maximum genera richness varied sharply across the range of latitude examined from the south to north poles for all three orders of aquatic insects. Ephemeroptera richness showed 3 peaks (∼30°S, 10°N, and 40°N) with highest richness near 5–10°N and 40°N latitude. Plecoptera richness was distinctly highest at ∼40°N latitude with a similar peak at 40°S latitude. Trichoptera richness showed less latitudinal variation than the other taxa but was slightly higher near the equator and at 40°N and S latitude than at other latitudes. Genera richness generally declined with increasing elevation, except for Plecoptera. Maximum genera richness increased steadily with a measure of regional terrestrial net primary production and declined sharply with a measure of hydrologic disturbance for all orders. Richness varied widely among both biogeographical realms and biomes, although ca 2 times as much variation in richness was associated with biome as biogeographic realm. Richness for each order was highest in different biogeographic realms, but all orders had highest richness in broadleaf forest biomes. These latter results imply that spatial variation in local richness of stream insects is more strongly affected by contemporary ecological factors than by historical biogeography and that maintenance of intact forested landscapes may be critical to the conservation of stream invertebrate faunas.",,

The study had 3 objectives: 1) to evaluate the validity of aggregating reference site data into a single bioregion, 2) to select biological metrics that best discriminated reference sites from sites impaired by habitat disturbance and organic pollution, and 3) to combine these metrics into an index of biological quality. Macroinvertebrate, physical habitat, and water-quality data were collected in 106 streams during autumn 1995. Fifty-five sites were reference, 34 sites had habitat stresses, and 17 sites had water-quality stresses. Classification of reference sites divided the coastal plain into 3 bioregions, separated north and south by Chesapeake Bay and separated east and west by ecoregion. Five metrics were effective at discriminating impairment: number of taxa, number of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) taxa, % Ephemeroptera, Hilsenhoff Biotic Index, and % clinger mode of existence. An aggregated index, the Coastal Plain Macroinvertebrate Index (CPMI), was developed using these metrics. The CPMI accurately identified 86% of impaired sites. The precision of CPMI scores was estimated to be ±10% (3 scoring units out of 30) at the 90% confidence interval. The CPMI accurately assigned both habitat disturbance and water-quality impairment indicating a similar degree of ecological impact from these 2 stressors. Guidance is provided for applying the CPMI to other macroinvertebrate data sets in the region.",,

The divergence of D. croaticus populations in Croatia and allopatric Drusus species in Bosnia dated to the Pleistocene, showing the importance of this time period for the origin and diversification of Balkan endemic taxa. The divergence of more distantly related species dated to the Late Miocene/Early Pliocene. Population genetic and phylogeographic analysis of 115 individuals from 11 populations of D. croaticus revealed a high level of genetic differentiation and absence of gene flow between populations separated by more than 10 km. The existence of allopatrically fragmented lineages in D. croaticus and the endemic Bosnian species is most likely the result of long‐term isolation in multiple microrefugia, probably due to the specific habitat requirements and life‐history traits of Drusinae coupled with the topographic complexity and historical changes in geomorphology of the region. Overall, these findings shed light on the processes generating the high genetic complexity of this refugial region that parallels the ‘refugia within refugia’ pattern widely reported from the Iberian refugium.",,

In the shallows it formed beds within the species-rich native Potamogeton–Vallisneria community. This paper compares fish and prey-invertebrate abundance and distribution (i) before and after the milfoil invasion for a series of depth zones (1972 relative to 1979–1980), and (ii) in communities of M. spicatum relative to native macrophytes in the littoral zone shallows in the summer of 1980. At a depth of 2.0–3.5 m (major M. spicatum zone), there were significantly fewer bluegill but more black crappie and golden shiner in 1979–1980 compared with 1972, and significantly fewer isopods, chironomid and trichopteran larvae, and ephemeropteran nymphs. Differences were greatest in late summer. Inshore and offshore from the M. spicatum zone, differences were minor, suggesting that the invader, not time, was responsible. At a 1.0- to 1.3-m depth in the summer of 1980, three to four times as many fish occurred during the daytime feeding period in the Potamogeton–Vallisneria community than in the M. spicatum area. In the benthos, beneath the native beds, five major taxa of prey invertebrates were three to seven times more abundant. The foliage of Potamogeton plus Vallisneria supported twice as many invertebrates per square metre in late summer than did M. spicatum. Insect emergences over the summer (May–September) were twice as high. Up to the present, the net impact of the habitat change on the fish populations of Lake Opinicon has not been great. If in the future M. spicatum were to replace the rich native macrophyte beds in the shallows, this would be cause for concern.",,

Biological invasions are widely recognised as a significant component of human‐caused environmental change and a primary threat to native biodiversity. The negative impacts of species invasions are particularly evident for freshwater crayfish faunas. 2. This study provides novel insight into the ecological effects of native and non‐native crayfish on zoobenthic communities (with emphasis on the non‐native rusty crayfish, Orconectes rusticus ) across broad scales by combining a meta‐analysis of small‐scale experimental studies with a long‐term observational study conducted over a 24 year period in Sparkling Lake, Wisconsin, U.S.A. (46°00′N, 89°42′W). 3. The meta‐analysis summarised quantitatively the results of cage experiments for seven species of crayfish spanning four continents. We found that total zoobenthos densities (primarily Gastropoda and Diptera) were significantly lower in treatments containing crayfish relative to controls; a result that was significant for non‐native crayfish but not for crayfish in their native range, perhaps owing to a small sample size. In contrast to other species, rusty crayfish were also negatively associated with Ephemeroptera. 4. Results from the time series analysis comparing temporal trends in rusty crayfish and invertebrate abundances from Sparkling Lake were consistent with the findings from the meta‐analysis. Rusty crayfish were negatively correlated with the abundance of total zoobenthos, Diptera, Ephemeroptera and Odonata, as well as families of Trichoptera. 5. By coupling the results from short and long‐term research, our study offers greater insight into the nature of crayfish‐invertebrate interactions in aquatic systems, revealing consistent effects of invasive crayfish on native fauna. The control and management of invasive species is facilitated by the knowledge that well executed small‐scale studies may be extrapolated to understand larger‐scale ecological interactions.",,

The US Environmental Protection Agency developed a field-based specific conductance (SC) benchmark of 300 µS/cm for streams affected by mountain-top mining operations. The benchmark has been criticized because of the potential influence of confounding variables and difficulty in demonstrating a causal relationship between elevated SC and macroinvertebrate responses. We conducted 4 stream mesocosm experiments to quantify the effects of major ions on aquatic insect assemblages. We exposed insects from streams with low (60–72 µS/cm) and moderate (200–250 µS/cm) SC to major ions at values bracketing 300 µS/cm. We measured community metabolism, macroinvertebrate drift, community composition, and survival. Sixty-six taxa were exposed to NaHCO3, MgSO4, and NaCl in 4 mesocosm experiments, and 8 dominant families/subfamilies occurred in sufficient densities to develop SC-response relationships. Significant SC-response relationships occurred for each major ion tested. Drift increased and community metabolism decreased with increasing SC. Ephemeroptera were highly sensitive, whereas Trichoptera and Diptera were relatively tolerant. EC20 values (the SC that resulted in a 20% difference from controls) ranged from 151 to 3615 µS/cm and were >300 µS/cm for most endpoints. Mayfly drift, abundance of baetid and heptageniid mayflies, total mayfly abundance, and community metabolism were affected at SC levels near or <300 µS/cm. EC20 values were lower for NaHCO3 and MgSO4 than for NaCl, indicating greater toxicity of these 2 salts. Effects were greater on communities from the low- than the high-SC stream. Thus, accounting for context-dependent responses may be important when establishing contaminant benchmarks or thresholds. The 300-µS/cm benchmark is protective of aquatic insect communities in naturally low-conductivity streams.",,

Increased fine sediment input caused by agricultural development is expected to act as a stressor for stream ecosystems. In a large‐scale field experiment, we added fine river sand to 50‐m reaches of three second‐order streams in each of four categories of catchment development (ungrazed tussock grasslands, grazed pasture, dairying and deer farming) and measured the responses of macroinvertebrates and aquatic moss. 2. Before addition, fine sediment cover differed between land uses, being lowest in tussock (7%), intermediate in pasture (30%) and dairy (47%) and highest in deer streams (88%). Sediment addition increased cover by one land‐use category (e.g. augmented sediment cover in tussock streams was similar to pre‐existing cover in pasture streams), and cover remained high in impact reaches (compared with controls) throughout the 5‐week experiment. Sediment addition did not change concentrations of phosphate, nitrate and ammonium, which were generally highest in dairy streams and lowest in tussock streams. 3. Aquatic mosses (most common in tussock, absent in dairy and deer), invertebrate density (highest in deer, lowest in tussock), taxon richness (highest in pasture, lowest in deer) and diversity (highest in pasture and tussock, lowest in dairy and deer) all differed between land uses. Sediment addition resulted in reductions of moss cover, invertebrate taxon richness and richness of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera in impact relative to control reaches. 4. The impact of sediment addition was strongest in pasture streams where pre‐existing sediment cover was moderate and richness and diversity of the invertebrate community highest. However, even in the already sediment‐rich and species‐poor deer streams, density of one common taxon was reduced significantly by sediment addition, and another two were affected in the same way in dairy streams, the second‐most intense land use. 5. Our experiment has disentangled the impact of sediment addition from other concomitant land‐use effects that could not be reliably distinguished in previous research, which has mainly consisted of correlative studies or unrealistically small‐scale experiments.",,

Impacts of freshwater salinization on biota are strongly mediated by evolutionary history, as this is a major factor determining species physiological salinity tolerance. Freshwater insects dominate most flowing waters, and the common lotic insect orders Ephemeroptera (mayflies), Plecoptera (stoneflies) and Trichoptera (caddisflies) are particularly salt-sensitive. Tolerances of existing taxa, rapid adaption, colonization by novel taxa (from naturally saline environments) and interactions between species will be key drivers of assemblages in saline lotic systems. Here we outline a conceptual framework predicting how communities may change in salinizing rivers. We envision that a relatively small number of taxa will be saline-tolerant and able to colonize salinized rivers (e.g. most naturally saline habitats are lentic; thus potential colonizers would need to adapt to lotic environments), leading to depauperate communities in these environments.",,

In this study, the subcellular partitioning of metals in operationally defined metal-sensitive and detoxified fractions were analyzed in five insect taxa. Samples were collected in two separate years along an extensive metal contamination gradient in the Clark Fork River (MT, USA) to determine if interspecific differences in the metal concentrations of metal-sensitive fractions and detoxified fractions were linked to the differences in distributions of taxa relative to the gradient. Most of the Cd, Cu, and Zn body burdens were internalized and potentially biologically active in all taxa, although all taxa appeared to detoxify metals (e.g., metal bound to cytosolic metal-binding proteins). Metal concentrations associated with metal-sensitive fractions were highest in the mayflies Epeorus albertae and Serratella tibialis, which were rare or absent from the most contaminated sites but occurred at less contaminated sites. Relatively low concentrations of Cu were common to the tolerant taxa Hydropsyche spp. and Baetis spp., which were widely distributed and dominant in the most contaminated sections of the river. This suggested that distributions of taxa along the contamination gradient were more closely related to the bioaccumulation of Cu than of other metals. Metal bioaccumulation did not appear to explain the spatial distribution of the caddisfly Arctopsyche grandis, considered to be a bioindicator of metal effects in the river. Thus, in this system the presence/absence of most of these taxa from sites where metal exposure was elevated could be differentiated on the basis of differences in metal bioaccumulation.",,

Broad‐scale assessments of biodiversity often rely on the use of surrogate taxa, whose reliability has rarely been tested, particularly in freshwater systems. Here we use data from 46 ponds in two regions of the U.K. to explore the performance of macroinvertebrate taxa as surrogates for the rapid assessment of pond biodiversity. For the four dominant taxonomic groups in these ponds (Chironomidae, Coleoptera, Gastropoda and Trichoptera) we explore cross‐taxon species richness relationships in each of the two regions, and also determine the degree of concordance between the different taxa in accurately representing the similarity relationships between pond assemblages. 2. Patterns of cross‐taxon congruence in species richness were highly variable among taxa and study sites, making the use of a single taxon as a predictor of overall macroinvertebrate species richness problematic. In contrast, all four taxa show &gt;70% congruence with the pattern of community similarity between sites resulting from the entire macroinvertebrate dataset, this result being consistent within and between regions. Canonical correspondence analysis demonstrated that all taxa were related in a similar manner to measured environmental parameters, meaning that limited additional ecological information is gained by including a wider range of pond taxa in rapid site assessment. 3. Single taxonomic groups can, therefore, perform consistently as indicators of community similarity between ponds, and no one taxon dramatically outperforms any other in this respect. The relative merits of the four focal taxa as surrogates for pond invertebrate assemblage composition are discussed with reference to ease of survey, ease of identification and ecological range occupied. 4. It is suggested that Coleoptera have a number of advantages as a surrogate taxon, being diverse, easily sampled, readily identified, taxonomically stable, ecologically well understood and occurring across a wide spectrum of pond types. They are therefore recommended for use as a focal group in rapid pond biodiversity assessments, employing an approach such as ours, which examines patterns of assemblage similarity, rather than species richness alone.",,

Here, we present the results of longer‐term insect monitoring from two locations in the Netherlands: nature development area De Kaaistoep and nature reserves near Wijster. Based on data from insects attracted to light in De Kaaistoep, macro‐moths (macro‐Lepidoptera), beetles (Coleoptera), and caddisflies (Trichoptera) have declined in the mean number of individuals counted per evening over the period of 1997–2017, with annual rates of decline of 3.8, 5.0 and 9.2%, respectively. Other orders appeared stable [true bugs (Hemiptera: Heteroptera and Auchenorrhyncha) and mayflies (Ephemeroptera)] or had uncertainty in their trend estimate [lacewings (Neuroptera)]. Based on 48 pitfall traps near Wijster, ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) showed a mean annual decline of 4.3% in total numbers over the period of 1985–2016. Nonetheless, declines appeared stronger after 1995. For macro‐moths, the mean of the trends of individual species was comparable to the annual trend in total numbers. Trends of individual ground beetle species, however, suggest that abundant species performed worse than rare ones. When translated into biomass estimates, our calculations suggest a reduction in total biomass of approximately 61% for macro‐moths as a group and at least 42% for ground beetles, by extrapolation over a period of 27 years. Heavier ground beetles and macro‐moths did not decline more strongly than lighter species, suggesting that heavy species did not contribute disproportionately to biomass decline. Our results broadly echo recent reported trends in insect biomass in Germany and elsewhere.",,

We examined the spatial variation in water quality, benthic composition and ash-free dry standing biomass (AFDM) among the bedrock-defined geomorphological reaches in three turbidity segments of the Colorado River between Glen Canyon Dam and Diamond Creek, Arizona, including most of the Grand Canyon. This 387-km long study area supported virtually no Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera or Trichoptera, probably because cold, stenothermic, hypolimnetic releases limited maximum aestival warming to 17·1°C. The benthos displayed abrupt, physically related decreases in AFDM over distance from the dam and in the varial zone. The 26-km long clear water segment between the dam and the Paria River supported a depauperate Cladophora glomerata/epiphyte/chironomid/Gammarus lacustris/lumbricine/Physella sp. assemblage, and ooze-dwelling oligochaetes. This segment contained 6·9% of the aquatic habitat below the 140 m3/s (normal minimum) discharge stage of the Colorado River study area, but supported 63·5% of the benthic primary producer AFDM and 87% of the benthic consumer AFDM in the entire study area. Turbidity increased and light penetration decreased immediately downstream from the confluence of the small, turbid Paria River, and further downstream from the Little Colorado River confluence. The benthos downstream from the Paria River was abruptly replaced by an Oscillatoria/Simuliium assemblage with a mean AFDM of <0·12 g C/m2. Dam-related effects on water clarity, varial flow and water temperature overrode geomorphological influences on habitat availability. These results generally support the SDC, in that recovery of the benthos did not take place over distance in this large river ecosystem; however, geomorphological differences in substratum availability between reaches mediated dam and tributary effects on water clarity and benthic AFDM. Interactions between flow regulation and geomorphology produce a pattern of circuitous recovery of some physical river ecosystem characteristics over distance from the dam, but not of the benthos. Improving discharge management for endangered native fish populations requires detailed understanding of existing and potential benthic development, and trophic interactions, throughout the geomorphological reaches and turbidity segments in this river. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,

Despite extensive previous morphological work, little phylogenetic agreement has been reached about the relationship among the three suborders--Annulipalpia, Spicipalpia, and Integripalpia--or about the monophyly of Spicipalpia. In an effort to resolve this conflict, we sequenced fragments of the large and small subunit nuclear ribosomal RNAs (1078 nt; D1, D3, V4-5), the nuclear elongation factor 1 alpha gene (EF-1 alpha; 1098 nt), and a fragment of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI; 411 nt). Seventy adult and larval morphological characters were reanalyzed and added to molecular data in a combined analysis. We evaluated signal and homoplasy in each of the molecular datasets and attempted to rank the particular datasets according to how appropriate they were for inferring relationships among suborders. This evaluation included testing for conflict among datasets, comparing tree lengths among alternative hypotheses, measuring the left-skew of tree-length distributions from maximally divergent sets of taxa, evaluating the recovery of expected clades, visualizing whether or not substitutions were accumulating with time, and estimating nucleotide compositional bias. Although all these measures cast doubt on the reliability of the deep-level signal coming from the nucleotides of the COI and EF-1 alpha genes, these data could still be included in combined analyses without overturning the results from the most conservative marker, the rRNA. The different datasets were found to be evolving under extremely different rates. A site-specific likelihood method for dealing with combined data with nonoverlapping parameters was proposed, and a similar weighting scheme under parsimony was evaluated. Among our phylogenetic conclusions, we found Annulipalpia to be the most basal of the three suborders, with Spicipalpia and Integripalpia forming a clade. Monophyly of Annulipalpia and Integripalpia was confirmed, but the relationships among spicipalpians remain equivocal.",,

Anthropogenic activities can increase fine sediment supply to streams over multiple spatial and temporal extents. Identifying the processes responsible, and the scale at which any effects on stream organisms become evident, are key management needs, but appropriately scaled surveys are surprisingly few. 2. We surveyed macroinvertebrates and superficial fine sediments at two spatial resolutions (reach‐ and patch‐scale) in tributaries of the River Usk, a temperate, montane catchment in rural Wales (U.K.). Land use, habitat and geomorphological character were measured on‐site or derived from an existing database (=Fluvial Audit). We aimed to identify: (i) how in‐stream sediments varied with land use and associated geomorphology; (ii) likely consequences for macroinvertebrates and (iii) any scale‐dependence in relationships between macroinvertebrates and sediment character. 3. At both the reach‐ and patch‐scales, bed cover by fine sediment was related directly to the extent of eroding banks 500 m upstream. In turn, sedimentation and bank erosion were negatively correlated with catchment or riparian woodland extent. 4. At the reach scale, macroinvertebrate composition varied with catchment land use and stream chemistry, with richness declining as rough grazing or woodland was replaced by improved grassland. There was no response to deposited sediment except for weak increase in the relative abundance of oligochaetes. 5. By contrast, at the patch scale, fine sediments were accompanied by pronounced changes in invertebrate composition, and we ranked the 27 most common taxa according to their apparent sediment tolerance. General estimating equations showed that total and Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera richness decreased significantly by 20% and 25% at the most sediment impacted sites (30% cover) by comparison with sediment‐free sites. 6. We conclude that sediment deposition in the upper Usk system mostly reflects local bank erosion, with riparian woodland likely to mediate this process through bank stability. Fine sediment release had marked ecological effects, but these were detectable only at patch‐to‐patch scales. We suggest that investigation of localized sediment release in streams will benefit from scale‐dependent or scale‐specific sampling, and some effects could go undetected unless sample resolution is selected carefully.",,

In sub‐Saharan Africa, tropical forests are increasingly threatened by accelerating rates of forest conversion and degradation. In East Africa, the larger tracts of intact rainforest lie largely in protected areas surrounded by converted landscape. Thus, there is critical need to understand the functional links between large‐scale land use and changes in river conditions, and the implications of park boundaries on catchment integrity. 2. The objective of this study was to use the mosaic of heavily converted land and pristine forest created by the protection of the high‐altitude rainforest in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda to explore effects of deforestation on aquatic systems and the value of forest in buffering effects of adjacent land conversion. A set of 16 sites was selected over four drainages to include four categories of deforestation: agricultural land, deforested upstream (of the park boundary), forest edge (park boundary) and forest. We predicted that forest buffer (downstream or on the edge) would moderate effects of deforestation. To address this prediction, we quantified relationships between disturbance level and both physicochemical characters and traits of the macroinvertebrate assemblages during six sampling periods (February 2003 and June 2004). 3. Results of both principal components analysis and cluster analyses indicated differences in limnological variables among deforestation categories. PC1 described a gradient from deforested sites with poor water quality to pristine forested sites with relatively good water quality. Agricultural sites and deforested upstream sites generally had the highest turbidity, total dissolved solids (TDS), and conductivity values and low transparency values. Forest sites and boundary site groups generally exhibited low turbidity, TDS, and conductivity values and high water transparency values. Sites also clustered according to deforestation categories; forest and forested edge sites formed a cluster independent of both agricultural land and deforested‐upstream. 4. Water transparency, water temperature, and pH were the most important factors predicting benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages. Sensitive invertebrate families of Trichoptera, Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Odonata dominated forested sites with high water transparency, low water temperature, and low pH while the tolerant families of Ephemeroptera, Diptera, Hemiptera, and Coleoptera were abundant in agriculturally impacted sites with low water transparency, high water temperature, and high pH. 5. This study provides support for the importance of riparian buffers in moderating effects of deforestation. Forest and forested edge sites were more similar in both limnological and macroinvertebrate assemblage structure than sites within or downstream from agricultural lands. If the protected area cannot encompass the catchment, the use of rivers as park boundaries may help to maintain the biological integrity of the rivers by buffering one side of the watercourse.",,

Instream flow analyses assume that predictable changes in channel flow characteristics can, in turn, be used to predict the change in the density or distribution of lotic species or, more appropriately, the availability of useable habitat for those species. Five major hydraulic conditions most affect the distribution and ecological success of lotic biota: suspended load, bedload movement, and water column effects, such as turbulence, velocity profile, and substratum interactions (near‐bed hydraulics). The interactions of these hydraulic conditions upon the morphology and behavior of the individual organisms govern the distribution of aquatic biota. Historically, management decisions employing the Physical Habitat Simulation (PHABSIM) have focused upon prediction of available habitat for life stages of target fish species. Regulatory agencies have rarely included evaluation of benthos for flow reservations. Although ‘taxonomic discomfort’ may be cited for the reluctant use or creation of benthic criteria, we suggest that a basic misunderstanding of the links between benthic macroinvertebrate and the fish communities is still a problem. This is derived from the lack of a perceived ‘value’ that can be assigned to macroinvertebrate species. With the exception of endangered mussel species (for which PHABSIM analysis is probably inappropriate), this is understandable. However, it appears that there is a greater ability to predict macroinvertebrate distribution (that is, a response to the change in habitat quality or location) and diversity without complex population models. Also, habitat suitability criteria for water quality indicator taxa (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera; the so‐called ‘EPTs’) may also provide additional management options to stream regulators. The greatest application for macroinvertebrate criteria will be in low‐order streams where a more immediate link to fish communities can be established. We present an example from Queens Creek, in North Carolina, USA, in which monthly allocations required to preserve the integrity of the benthic macroinvertebrate community were significantly higher than for the target benthic fish species, Cottus bairdi . In the months when both Cottus and community diversity of macroinvertebrates were the ‘bottleneck’ life stages, preservation of only fish species could result in an additional 5–25% loss in macroinvertebrate habitat. We suggest that, as there becomes an increased emphasis on maintaining macroinvertebrates as monitors of stream health, there will be a concurrent emphasis on incorporating hydraulic habitat conditions as a part of bioassessment.

Macrophyte and macroinvertebrate species richness, and the extent of aquatic vegetation, were surveyed in 51 newly created or renovated ponds in mid and west Wales, together with a range of environmental variables. These data are analysed in relation to management issues including pond size, rate of development, planting for oxygenation, stocking with fish and shading by riparian trees. 2. Richness of both plants and invertebrates increases with vegetated area, but the relationships are weak. Similarities among assemblages in ponds are low and not related to the proximity of the ponds. It is likely that two small ponds would together support more species than a single large pond. 3. New ponds are colonized rapidly by plants and invertebrates. There is no relationship between age and the number of species in ponds that were at least one year old, except for invertebrates in ponds that were isolated from other wetland. As expected, the extent of aquatic vegetation increases with age. 4. Minimum dissolved oxygen levels decrease with the cover of floating plants and with extent of vegetation in relation to pond size. 5. There is no evidence that stocking with fish (mainly salmonids at low densities) influences the total number of species of either macrophytes or macroinvertebrates. However, the number of anisopteran (Insecta: Odonata) species is lower in stocked ponds and the number of trichopteran (Insecta) species is higher. 6. Macrophyte species richness increases with the percentage of the margin shaded by trees to a peak between 22% (emergent species) and 30% (submerged and floating species), and then declines. The number of species of invertebrates with short-lived flying adults (Odonata, Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera) decreases with the extent of riparian trees. Other invertebrates are unaffected. 7. The relationship between the survey results and existing management recommendations is discussed, emphasizing the need for field experiments to provide empirical support. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,

The (TTAGG) n sequence was present in 15 species and absent in 7 species. In a compilation of new and published data, we combined the distribution of (TTAGG) n telomere motif with the insect phylogenetic tree. The pattern of phylogenetic distribution of the TTAGG repeats clearly supported a hypothesis that the sequence was an ancestral motif of insect telomeres but was lost repeatedly during insect evolution. The motif was conserved in the ""primitive"" apterous insect orders, the Archaeognatha and Zygentoma, in the ""lower"" Neoptera (Plecoptera, Phasmida, Orthoptera, Blattaria, Mantodea, and Isoptera) with the exception of Dermaptera, and in Paraneoptera (Psocoptera, Thysanoptera, Auchenorrhyncha, and Sternorrhyncha) with the exception of Heteroptera. Surprisingly, the (TTAGG) n motif was not found in the ""primitive"" pterygotes, the Palaeoptera (Ephemeroptera and Odonata). The Endopterygota were heterogeneous for the occurrence of TTAGG repeats. The motif was conserved in Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, and Trichoptera but was lost in one clade formed by Diptera, Siphonaptera, and Mecoptera. It was also lost in Raphidioptera, whereas it was present in Megaloptera. In contrast with previous authors, we did not find the motif in Neuroptera. Finally, both TTAGG-positive and TTAGG-negative species were reported in Coleoptera. The repeated losses of TTAGG in different branches of the insect phylogenetic tree and, in particular, in the most successful lineage of insect evolution, the Endopterygota, suggest a backup mechanism in the genome of insects that enabled them frequent evolutionary changes in telomere composition.Key words: chromosomes, fluorescence in situ hybridization, FISH, insects, phylogeny, single primer PCR, Southern hybridization, telomere, telomeric repeats.",,

However, when used for DNA metabarcoding, estimation of taxa abundances and species detection are limited due to primer bias caused by highly variable primer binding sites across the COI gene. Therefore, we explored the ability of the 16S ribosomal DNA gene as an alternative metabarcoding marker for species level assessments. Ten bulk samples, each containing equal amounts of tissue from 52 freshwater invertebrate taxa, were sequenced with the Illumina NextSeq 500 system. The 16S primers amplified three more insect species than the Folmer COI primers and amplified more equally, probably due to decreased primer bias. Estimation of biomass might be less biased with 16S than with COI, although variation in read abundances of two orders of magnitudes is still observed. According to these results, the marker choice depends on the scientific question. If the goal is to obtain a taxonomic identification at the species level, then COI is more appropriate due to established reference databases and known taxonomic resolution of this marker, knowing that a greater proportion of insects will be missed using COI Folmer primers.

The value of measuring ecosystem functions in regular monitoring programs is increasingly being recognised as a potent tool for assessing river health. We measured the response of ecosystem metabolism, organic matter decomposition and strength loss, and invertebrate community composition across a gradient of catchment impairment defined by upstream landuse stress in two New Zealand streams. This was performed to determine if there were consistent responses among contrasting functional and structural indicators. 2. Rates of gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) ranged from 0.1 to 7.0 gO 2 m −2 day −1 and from 0.34 to 16.5 gO 2 m −2 day −1 respectively. Rates of GPP were variable across the landuse stress gradient, whereas ER increased linearly with the highest rates at the most impacted sites. Production/respiration (P/R) and net ecosystem metabolism (NEM) indicated that sites at the low and high ends of the stress gradient were heterotrophic with respiration rates presumably relying on organic matter from upstream sources, adjacent land or point sources. Sites with moderate impairment were predominantly autotrophic. 3. Declines in the tensile strength of the cotton strips showed no response across part of the gradient, but a strong response among the most impaired sites. The rate of mass loss of wooden sticks ( Betula platyphylla Sukaczev) changed from a linear response to a U‐shaped response across the impairment gradient after water temperature compensation, whereas leaf breakdown at a subset of sites suggested a linear loss in mass per degree‐day. Three macroinvertebrate metrics describing the composition of the invertebrate community and its sensitivity to pollution showed similar linear inverse responses to the landuse stress gradient. 4. The first axis of a redundancy analysis indicated an association between landuse stress and various measures of water quality, and wooden stick mass loss, the invertebrate metric % EPT [percentage of macroinvertebrate taxa belonging to the Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (excluding Hydroptilidae] taxa, P/R and NEM, supporting the utility of these structural and functional metrics for assessing degree of landuse stress. The second axis was more strongly associated with catchment size, ER and GPP which suggests that these indicators were responding to differences in stream size. 5. Our results suggest that nonlinear responses to catchment impairment need to be considered when interpreting measurements of ecosystem function. Functional indicators could be useful for detecting relatively subtle changes where the slope of the response curve is maximised and measurements at the low and high ends of the impairment gradient are roughly equivalent. Such responses may be particularly valuable for detecting early signs of degradation at high quality sites, allowing management responses to be initiated before the degradation becomes too advanced, or for detecting initial moves away from degraded states during the early stages of restoration. Close links between structural and functional indices of river health across an impairment gradient are not necessarily expected or desirable if the aim is to minimise redundancy among ecological indicators.",,

Thus, their distributions are patchy at 2 spatial scales. We examined the association between mussel assemblage structure and macroinvertebrate assemblage structure at these 2 spatial scales in rivers of the Ouachita Highlands, Arkansas and Oklahoma, USA. We used multivariate variation partitioning techniques to relate variation in benthic macroinvertebrate distribution and abundance to variation in mussel assemblages, environmental variables, spatial variables, and overlapping or shared variation between these components. At the patch scale, total densities of macroinvertebrates and dominant groups (Oligochaeta, Chironomidae, Ephemeroptera, and Trichoptera) were significantly higher in patches containing mussels than where mussels were absent, and densities of macroinvertebrates were positively correlated with unionid density. In variation partitioning analyses, mussel assemblages explained almost ½ of the variation in macroinvertebrate assemblages at both spatial scales, even after removing effects of similar habitat (environmental variables) and biogeographic history (spatial variables).",,

Our aim was to learn more about how refuge-seeking behavior and life-history traits affect species persistence along the flow disturbance gradient. All taxa responded to incrementally increased flows in a recirculating laboratory flume with layered substrata by moving to deeper, more stable layers. However, snails made the most pronounced shift to protected sublayers. Caddisflies that remained on epibenthic surfaces during high flows laid draglines on surface rocks to effectively resist dislodgment. Very few individuals of any taxon were washed from epibenthic habitats by high flows alone. Simulated flash floods in artificial stream channels revealed that dislodgment was linked to substrate stability and that likelihood to be dislodged varied among taxa. Dislodgment was relatively low for mayflies and snails (∼8%) compared to caddisflies (20.7%) in stabilized patches of gravel. However, in unstable patches, dislodgment rates of both mayflies and caddisflies (both ∼30%) were significantly higher than those of snails. The relatively high dislodgment rate of caddisflies in both stable and unstable substrate patches was related to their propensity to occupy epibenthic surfaces. Mortality rates of mayflies (∼25%) were about 3× higher than those of the other 2 taxa in both patch types. Our results suggest that high dispersal capabilities seem particularly important for Deleatidium to persist in flood-prone streams, whereas short-term behavioral modifications play a key role in allowing the snails and caddisflies to persist in flow-variable habitats.",,

Catches of five species of caddisflies of the family Hydropsychidae ( Cheumatopsyche campyla , Cheumatopsyche speciosa , Hydropsyche hageni , Hydropsyche phalerata , Macrostemum zebratum ) and the mayfly Hexagenia (Ephemeridae) were used to examine inland distribution. 2. Inland dispersal was limited: catches of caddisflies declined at a greater than exponential rate with increasing distance from shore. Mean dispersal distance from the shoreline ranged from 650 to 1845 m. Smaller caddisfly species dispersed shorter distances than larger caddisflies and Hexagenia . 3. Inland distribution of adult caddisflies exhibited considerable interspecific variation: distribution was inconsistent among trials for Hexagenia , possibly owing to timing of collections in relation to periods of peak emergence. 4. Sex ratios of caddisflies were female biased at most sites. No consistent bias was observed for Hexagenia . Different inland distribution patterns were observed for males and females.

We analysed a large number of concurrent samples of macroinvertebrate communities and chemical indicators of eutrophication and organic pollution [total‐P, total‐N, NH 4 –N, biological oxygen demand (BOD 5 )] from 594 Danish stream sites. Samples were taken over an 11‐year time span as part of the Danish monitoring programme on the aquatic environment. Macroinvertebrate communities were sampled in spring using a standardised kick‐sampling procedure whereas chemical variables were sampled six to 24 times per year per site. Habitat variables were assessed once when macroinvertebrates were sampled. 2. The plecopteran Leuctra showed a significant negative exponential relationship ( r 2 = 0.90) with BOD 5 and occurred at only 16% of the sites with BOD 5 above 1.6 mg L −1 . Sharp declines with increasing BOD 5 levels were found for the trichopteran families Sericostomatidae and Glossosomatidae although they appeared to be slightly less sensitive than Leuctra . Other plecopterans such as Isoperla showed a similar type of response curve to Leuctra (negative exponential) but occurred at sites with relatively high concentrations of BOD 5 up to 3–4 mg L −1 . In contrast, the response curve of the isopod Asellus aquaticus followed a saturation function reaching a plateau above 3–4 mg L −1 BOD 5 and the dipteran Chironomus showed an exponential increase in occurrence with increasing BOD 5 concentration. 3. Macroinvertebrate occurrence appeared to be related primarily to concentrations of BOD 5 , NH 4 –N and total‐P whereas there were almost no relationships to total‐N. Occurrence of a number of taxa showed a stronger relationship to habitat conditions (width and substrate) than chemical variables. 4. Important macroinvertebrate taxa are reduced at concentrations of BOD 5 that are normally perceived as indicating unimpacted stream site conditions. Our results confirmed sensitivity/tolerance patterns used by existing bioassessment systems only to some degree.",,

The comparative study of this pattern is feasible and informative in orders such as Plecoptera, Ephemeroptera, Odonata, Diptera and Trichoptera in which all members of a population pass through the water-surface when emerging. Methods by which emergence rate can be measured are discussed. Four basic temporal patterns of emergence exist. Emergence may be (1) continuous with irregular fluctuations in rate; (2) rhythmic, with a lunar period; (3) sporadic, occurring at irregular intervals of a few days; or (4) seasonal. Examples of each of these patterns are given, and reference is made to the proximate and ultimate environmental factors which may be maintaining the patterns observed. Diurnal rhythms of emergence are excluded from consideration. When emergence is restricted seasonally in temperate latitudes, the degree of its synchronization within the emergence period varies widely but is usually constant and typical for a given species. This has provided the basis for an ecological classification of British Odonata, the validity of which is examined in the light of recent research.",,

We compiled a comprehensive data set from ecological monitoring below nine dams to evaluate the effects of these modifications on physicochemical conditions and benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages. Abiotic and biotic data were collected in tailwaters by the TVA for three dam operation “treatments” (i.e., before any modifications, following flow modifications, and following both flow and dissolved oxygen [DO] modifications) at three different stations (Upper, Middle, and Lower) located at increasing longitudinal distances below each dam. Analysis of variance was used to test for differences in ecological conditions among treatments and stations. Dam modifications had significant effects on both abiotic and biotic variables, and macroinvertebrate assemblages exhibited significant longitudinal differences. Yearly mean DO and mean minimum velocity increased following dam modifications. Across all sampling stations, macroinvertebrate family richness increased and the percentage of pollution‐tolerant macroinvertebrates (% Tolerant) decreased after dam modifications. Family richness also increased, and % Tolerant decreased, with increasing distance below the dams. Total abundance of macroinvertebrates increased after flow modifications and then decreased following changes in DO. The percentage of individuals belonging to the orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (% EPT) increased following flow and DO modifications, but only at the Upper station. EPT family richness was unaffected by increased flow alone but increased following increases in both flow and DO.

A rapid and reliable molecular protocol that also uses morphology is proposed because conventional approaches to associating undescribed larvae with adults have been slow and problematic. Male adults were identified before DNA sequence analyses were used. These identifications established morphospecies boundaries that were mapped on phylograms constructed from 2 independent gene fragments: mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and large subunit (28S) nuclear ribosomal DNA expansion fragment D2 (D2). Species boundaries were confirmed if they were monophyletic on both molecular phylograms. Larval associations were made with reference to the phylogenetic analyses under 2 criteria: sequence identity across both genes or nested placement within a reference species boundary. A total of 133 individuals belonging to Chinese Hydropsyche sensu lato group (including Hydropsyche [Hydropsyche], Hydropsyche [Occutanspsyche], Ceratopsyche, Mexipsyche, Hydatomanicus, and Herbertorossia) were included in our study to test the new protocol. D2 sequences (all individuals) and COI sequences (101 individuals) were obtained, and 2 independent phylograms were constructed using neighbor joining. Both fragments provided enough nucleotide changes to differentiate independently most Hydropsyche sensu lato species, with ambiguity in only a few species that eventually could be resolved with additional sequences and specimens. COI diverges significantly within some species, suggesting a need for caution when applying typical genetic divergence thresholds in species diagnoses. The study enabled us to establish a procedure for delimiting species boundaries and associating larvae and adults using DNA sequences and morphological evidence. Ideal sampling strategies for larval–adult association are suggested. Associating larvae and adults of hydropsychids using DNA sequences appears to be promising in terms of both reliability and speed.",,

This study analyzed phenotype-environment correlations in a fish invasion from initial absence until establishment in the headwater reach of the second largest European river, the Danube. Here, the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) formed 73% of the fish abundance and 58% of the fish biomass in rip-rap bank habitats after establishment. The time from invasion until establishment was only about two years, indicating rapid expansion. Founder populations from the invasion front were different from longer established round goby populations in demography, morphology, feeding behaviour, sex ratio and parasitic load, indicating that plasticity in these traits determines invasion success. Competitive ability was mostly dependent on growth/size-related traits rather than on fecundity. As revealed by stable isotope analyses, specimens at the invasion front had a higher trophic position in the food web and seem to benefit from lower food competition. Somatic performance seems to be more important than investment in reproduction during the early stages of the invasion process and upstream-directed range expansion is not caused by out-migrating weak or juvenile individuals that were forced to leave high density areas due to high competition. This mechanism might be true for downstream introductions via drift. Greater abundance and densities of acanthocephalan endoparasites were observed at the invasion front, which contradicts the expectation that invasion success is determined by lower parasitic pressure in newly invaded areas. Overall, the pronounced changes in fish and invertebrate communities with a dominance of alien species suggest invasional meltdown and a shift of the upper Danube River towards a novel ecosystem with species that have greater resistance to goby predation. This seems to contribute to overcoming biological resistance and improve rapidity of dispersal.",,

Watershed development had little effect on the total insect numbers (no./m 2 ), but shifted the taxonomic composition markedly. Relative abundance of Diptera (mainly chironomids) increased at more highly urbanized sites, while most other insect orders including Ephemeroptera (mayflies), Coleoptera (bettles), Megaloptera (dobsonflies), and Plecoptera (stone‐flies) decreased. Trichoptera (caddisfiles) exhibited a variable response. Genus diversity and richness (number of genera) were significantly higher in less urbanized streams. Two genera of chironomids were positively correlated with increased urbanization, while 14 other genera (scattered through several orders) were negatively related to human population density. Principal components analysis demonstrated a gradient from more urbanized to less urbanized stations based on generic and order level biological data. Results of this study indicate that watershed urbanization has a major impact on benthic insect communities even in the absence of point source discharges.",,

Wolf Point Creek in Glacier Bay, Alaska, a lake-fed stream that began to emerge from under glacial ice in the mid-1940s, offers an opportunity to address this imbalance. We examine the stream's development from 1977 to 2005, with reference to concepts of succession and community assembly. Dispersal constraints have influenced the succession, as non-insect taxa required at least 20 years to colonize. We suggest that tolerance is a major mechanism of macroinvertebrate community assembly. Most taxa, with the exception of the cold-tolerant first colonizers, have persisted within the community following colonization, although relative abundance has changed markedly with time. However, biotic processes do influence colonization and succession. Redd (nest) digging by spawning salmon creates disturbed patches that facilitate the persistence of some early colonizers, and riparian vegetation facilitates colonization by caddisflies and chironomids. We further suggest that both deterministic and stochastic elements influence succession and community assembly in streams. Our study highlights the importance of reestablishing riparian vegetation during stream restoration programs and of increased in-stream habitat complexity from inputs of coarse woody debris to improve nutrient retention, particularly of salmon carcasses.",,

The work of Ege showed conclusively that the ‘air stores’ of many aquatic insects can, if they are in communication with the spiracles, function as gills for a limited time. Such bubbles will, however, since they have no resistance to compression, gradually dissolve in the water unless there is opportunity for regular renewal at the surface. The significance of the concept of invasion coefficient is considered in relation to gas‐bubble respiration. The term plastron is restricted to a ‘gas store’ communicating with the tracheal system and usually in the form of a thin film of constant and negligible volume and large surface area, retained in position by a system of hydrofuge hairs or scales in such a manner that it is not subject to the ‘Ege effect’ under the normal conditions of its environment, and is therefore not liable to loss by diffusion. Provided there is adequate oxygen in solution in the medium, such a plastron can enable the insect to remain below indefinitely, obtaining all the oxygen it requires from the surrounding water. The structure and biology of Aphelocheirus as a representative plastron insect is described. The plastron hair‐pile appears to be so perfect that an additional pressure of 4–5 atm. is required before the insect is in danger of losing its plastron and becoming wet. The spiracular adaptations which secure communication between the plastron and the tracheal system are described. The theory of plastron respiration as established by a study of Aphelocheirus is outlined. It is shown that in Aphelocheirus it is fully efficient as a respiratory structure and that this method of respiration has here nearly, if not quite, attained theoretical perfection. The resistance of the plastron hair‐pile to wetting is also discussed, and it is shown that this insect appears to have attained a very nearly perfect compromise between the conflicting requirements of a large area of gas‐water interface for diffusion and a minute scale hair‐pile for efficient resistance to water penetration. The development of the plastron hair‐pile in the individual and the first appearance of gas on its surface are described. A survey of plastron respiration in the Coleoptera is given. There are here three main groups in which the method has been elaborated, and while probably none of them presents as efficient an equipment for the purpose as Aphelocheirus there are several which can be regarded as having reached virtual perfection for the particular environments in which they live. It is shown that the plastron insects can be divided conveniently into three groups on the basis of the scale and arrangement of the hair‐pile and the consequent efficiency of the resistance to wetting. A number of the Coleoptera carry, over and above the plastron, a thicker gas layer, the macro‐plastron, held either by longer hairs or by means of a ‘fluffing out’ of the plastron hairs. Such a macroplastron is unstable and can only be maintained by the grooming or special renewal activities of the insects. It is subject to the ‘Ege effect’ and thus resembles in respiratory action a gas bubble rather than a plastron. It may, however, constitute an important first line of defence against wetting, and insects which have a macroplastron provide a number of transitional forms between gas‐bubble respiration and true plastron respiration. The distinction is made between ‘water‐proofing’ and ‘rain‐proofing’. ‘Waterproofing’ implies resistance to water under pressure and this demands a fine‐scale structure of some rigidity under a maximum of solid‐liquid contact. ‘Rain‐proofing’, on the other hand, implies no pressure of water and requires a more rigid structure of larger scale, the hairs being resistant to matting by lateral surface forces. For such rain‐proofing larger hairs are desirable as giving a minimum solid‐liquid contact. It is possible to trace the development of both types of structure among aquatic and semi‐aquatic insects. Some of the ecological implications of plastron respiration are described. A number of other instances of water‐resistant hair‐piles and felts are considered in relation to the evolution of plastron respiration. In the Hemiptera there appear to be no other forms approaching Aphelocheirus in plastron efficiency. In the Trichoptera and Lepidoptera there are one or two semi‐plastron forms and one moth, Acentropus niveus, which is perhaps a true plastron insect. The parasitic Hymenoptera provide a number of interesting problems in relation to the wetting and water protection of the cuticle. The larva of one aquatic ichneumonid Agriotypus spins a ribbon‐like appendage to the cocoon, which contains air and appears to act as a plastron. The existence of water‐resistant hair‐piles in the remaining groups of the insects and arachnids is briefly surveyed.",,

In this paper, we describe responses of benthic, trout stream communities to replicated, whole-ecosystem perturbations resulting from pathogen-induced reductions in populations of a dominant grazer, the caddisfly Glossosoma nigrior. Previous small-scale experiments suggested that Glossosoma had strong competitive effects on other grazers (through exploitation) and small-bodied filter-feeders (through interference). Glossosoma populations collapsed in a number of Michigan trout streams since the late 1980s and have been maintained at low levels by recurrent pathogen outbreaks. Here we address the effects on periphyton, grazers, and filter-feeders of parasite-induced Glossosoma reductions in six streams for which considerable pre- and post-collapse data are available, and we compare the results of this large-scale perturbation to responses predicted from a small-scale experiment that had been previously conducted in one of these streams. Periphyton and most grazers and filter-feeders showed marked increases in abundance following reduction in Glossosoma populations. Several grazers that were rare or absent prior to Glossosoma collapse have established sizable populations, suggesting that they had been excluded by competition with Glossosoma. The small-scale experiment successfully predicted the direction of response of most taxa to whole-stream reductions in Glossosoma abundance, but it tended to underestimate the extent and magnitude of Glossosoma's effects in the community. In these systems, observations at larger spatial and temporal scales have been essential to developing a clearer understanding of the mechanisms structuring communities.",,

Floods and low flows are hydrological events that influence river ecosystems, but few studies have compared their relative importance in structuring invertebrate communities. Invertebrates were sampled in riffles and runs at eight sites along 40 km of a New Zealand gravel‐bed river every 1–3 months over 2.5 years, during which time a number of large flood and low flow events occurred. Flows were high in winter and spring, and low in summer and autumn. Four flow‐related variables were calculated from hydrological data: flow on the day of sampling ( Q sample ), maximum and minimum flow between successive samples ( Q max and Q min , respectively), and the number of days since the last bed‐moving flood ( N days ). 2. The invertebrate community was summarised by relative densities of the 19 most abundant taxa and four biotic metrics [total abundance, taxon richness, the number of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera taxa (i.e. EPT richness), and per cent EPT]. Invertebrate density fluctuated greatly, and was high in summer and autumn, and low during winter and spring. Stepwise multiple regression (SMR) analysis was used to investigate relationships between the invertebrate community and season, flow, habitat and water temperature. 3. Seasonal variables were included in almost 50% of the SMR models, while flow‐related variables were included in &gt;75% of models. Densities of many taxa were negatively correlated to Q min and Q max , and positively correlated to N days , suggesting that while high flows reduced invertebrate densities, densities recovered with increasing time following a flood. Although season and flow were confounded in this study, many of the taxa analysed display little seasonal variation in abundance, suggesting that flow‐related variables were more important in structuring communities than seasonal changes in density associated with life‐cycles. 4. Five discrete flood and low flow events were identified and changes to invertebrate communities before and after these events examined. Invertebrate densities decreased more commonly after floods than after low flows, and there was a significant positive relationship between the number of taxa showing reductions in density and flood magnitude. Densities of most invertebrates either remained unchanged, or increased after low flow events, except for four taxa whose densities declined after a very long period (up to 9 months) of low flow. This decline was attributed to autogenic sloughing of thick periphyton communities and subsequent loss of habitat for these taxa. 5. Invertebrate communities changed more after floods and the degree of change was proportional to flood magnitude. Community similarity increased with increasing time since the last disturbance, suggesting that the longer stable flows lasted, the less the community changed. These results suggest that invertebrate communities in the Waipara River were controlled by both floods and low flows, but that the relative effects of floods were greater than even extended periods of extreme low flow. 6. Hydraulic conditions in riffles and runs were measured throughout the study. Riffles had consistently faster velocities, but were shallower and narrower than runs at all measured flows. Invertebrate density in riffles was expressed as a percentage of total density and regressed against the flow‐related variables to see whether invertebrate locations changed according to flow. Significant negative relationships were observed between the per cent density of common taxa in riffles and Q sample , Q max and Q min . This result suggests either that these animals actively drifted into areas of faster velocity during low flows, or that their densities within riffles increased as the width of these habitats declined.",,

Insects are among the most affected groups, with documented decreases in abundance up to 76% in the last 25–30 years in some terrestrial ecosystems. Identifying the underlying drivers is a major obstacle as most ecosystems are affected by multiple stressors simultaneously and in situ measurements of environmental variables are often missing. In our study, we investigated a headwater stream belonging to the most common stream type in Germany located in a nature reserve with no major anthropogenic impacts except climate change. We used the most comprehensive quantitative long‐term data set on aquatic insects available, which includes weekly measurements of species‐level insect abundance, daily water temperature and stream discharge as well as measurements of additional physicochemical variables for a 42‐year period (1969–2010). Overall, water temperature increased by 1.88 °C and discharge patterns changed significantly. These changes were accompanied by an 81.6% decline in insect abundance, but an increase in richness (+8.5%), Shannon diversity (+22.7%), evenness (+22.4%), and interannual turnover (+34%). Moreover, the community's trophic structure and phenology changed: the duration of emergence increased by 15.2 days, whereas the peak of emergence moved 13.4 days earlier. Additionally, we observed short‐term fluctuations (&lt;5 years) in almost all metrics as well as complex and nonlinear responses of the community toward climate change that would have been missed by simply using snapshot data or shorter time series. Our results indicate that climate change has already altered biotic communities severely even in protected areas, where no other interacting stressors (pollution, habitat fragmentation, etc.) are present. This is a striking example of the scientific value of comprehensive long‐term data in capturing the complex responses of communities toward climate change.",,

However, sequencing errors in high-throughput sequencing instruments are fairly common, usually requiring reads to be clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs), losing information on intraspecific diversity in the process. While Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) haplotype information is limited in resolving intraspecific diversity it is nevertheless often useful e.g. in a phylogeographic context, helping to formulate hypotheses on taxon distribution and dispersal. Methods This study combines sequence denoising strategies, normally applied in microbial research, with additional abundance-based filtering to extract haplotype information from freshwater macroinvertebrate metabarcoding datasets. This novel approach was added to the R package “JAMP” and can be applied to COI amplicon datasets. We tested our haplotyping method by sequencing (i) a single-species mock community composed of 31 individuals with 15 different haplotypes spanning three orders of magnitude in biomass and (ii) 18 monitoring samples each amplified with four different primer sets and two PCR replicates. Results We detected all 15 haplotypes of the single specimens in the mock community with relaxed filtering and denoising settings. However, up to 480 additional unexpected haplotypes remained in both replicates. Rigorous filtering removes most unexpected haplotypes, but also can discard expected haplotypes mainly from the small specimens. In the monitoring samples, the different primer sets detected 177–200 OTUs, each containing an average of 2.40–3.30 haplotypes per OTU. The derived intraspecific diversity data showed population structures that were consistent between replicates and similar between primer pairs but resolution depended on the primer length. A closer look at abundant taxa in the dataset revealed various population genetic patterns, e.g. the stonefly Taeniopteryx nebulosa and the caddisfly Hydropsyche pellucidula showed a distinct north–south cline with respect to haplotype distribution, while the beetle Oulimnius tuberculatus and the isopod Asellus aquaticus displayed no clear population pattern but differed in genetic diversity. Discussion We developed a strategy to infer intraspecific genetic diversity from bulk invertebrate metabarcoding data. It needs to be stressed that at this point this metabarcoding-informed haplotyping is not capable of capturing the full diversity present in such samples, due to variation in specimen size, primer bias and loss of sequence variants with low abundance. Nevertheless, for a high number of species intraspecific diversity was recovered, identifying potentially isolated populations and taxa for further more detailed phylogeographic investigation.

The relative sensitivity of invertebrates to 5 different classes of insecticides was calculated at the genus, family, and order levels using the acute toxicity data available in the US Environmental Protection Agency ECOTOX database. Biological trait information was linked to the calculated relative sensitivity to evaluate correlations between traits and sensitivity and to calculate a vulnerability index, which combines intrinsic sensitivity and traits describing the recovery potential of populations partially exposed to insecticides (e.g., voltinism, flying strength, occurrence in drift). The analysis shows that the relative sensitivity of arthropods depends on the insecticide mode of action. Traits such as degree of sclerotization, size, and respiration type showed good correlation to sensitivity and can be used to make predictions for invertebrate taxa without a priori sensitivity knowledge. The vulnerability analysis revealed that some of the Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera taxa were vulnerable to all insecticide classes and indicated that particular gastropod and bivalve species were potentially vulnerable. Microcrustaceans (e.g., daphnids, copepods) showed low potential vulnerability, particularly in lentic ecosystems. The methods described in the present study can be used for the selection of focal species to be included as part of ecological scenarios and higher tier risk assessments.

Such alterations are likely to increase in the future, yet almost nothing is known about their impacts on the littoral macroinvertebrate community. 2 Macroinvertebrates were studied in seven German lowland lakes exhibiting natural shorelines (reference), retaining walls, ripraps and recreational beaches to examine impacts on the eulittoral (0–0·2 m water depth) and infralittoral (0·2–1·2 m water depth) communities associated with the three types of shoreline development. 3 Among sites, eulittoral species richness and abundance of Coleoptera, Gastropoda, Trichoptera, shredders and xylophagous species were lowest on beaches and retaining walls but ripraps did not differ significantly from natural shorelines. Retaining walls and ripraps had no significant impact on the infralittoral macroinvertebrate community. Conversely, beaches had significantly lower infralittoral species richness and abundance of Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera and shredders than natural shorelines. Furthermore, species richness was correlated positively with habitat heterogeneity expressed as number of habitat types. 4 Among lakes, whole-lake littoral macroinvertebrate density increased with increasing proportion of developed shorelines due to increasing abundances of Chironomidae. The remaining macroinvertebrate major groups decreased with increasing proportion of shoreline development. 5 Synthesis and applications. The biological impacts of shoreline development in lowland lakes depend upon the extent to which structural complexity and heterogeneity of littoral habitats are reduced. Hence, we recommend that management programmes focus upon the conservation of littoral habitat complexity and habitat heterogeneity. The biological effects of shoreline development may be assessed efficiently by combining an assessment of the morphological status of lakeshores and information on macroinvertebrate indicator species with a defined response to the loss of their preferred habitats.",,

Habitat features and macroinvertebrate communities were surveyed in 66 predominantly upland streams throughout Wales and Scotland to assess the efficacy of riparian management (as `buffer strips') in protecting stream resources during commercial forestry. 2. Habitat data were reduced by principal components analysis (PCA). Macroinvertebrates in the stream margins and riffles were considered separately, and ordination of the community data was by DECORANA. 3. Habitat gradients recognized between the streams from PCA included trends in size, ionic strength, acidity, substratum type, and in the characteristics of marginal habitats. The latter represented a change from margins dominated by `soft' vegetation features to margins composed of `hard' features such as tree roots, rock and stones. 4. Marginal habitat characteristics differed between streams with different riparian management. Streams with `harder' margins occurred where the banks were covered with either conifers or broadleaves. Streams with `softer' margins occurred in seminatural moorland, and where a `buffer strip' of moorland vegetation had been retained along the stream at the planting stage. Streams in conifer forest in which a riparian buffer strip had been cleared retrospectively were intermediate. 5. For any given pH, aluminium concentrations were significantly higher in streams draining conifer catchments than in streams draining whole catchments of moorland or deciduous woodland. This effect occurred irrespective of buffer strips in conifer catchments. 6. The taxon richnesses of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and all taxa combined, in both riffles and margins, declined significantly with increasing acidity and aluminium concentration. Primary ordination axes from both habitats correlated with taxon richness, and hence also with pH and aluminium. However, there were significant effects on the ordination scores by riparian management, due mostly to reduced taxon richnesses in conifer sites without buffer strips. Significant effects remained even after accounting for increased aluminium concentration at conifer sites. 7. We conclude that gradients related to acidity are dominant correlates with the composition of invertebrate communities in upland British streams. However, riparian management can influence stream habitat structure and, to some extent, the macroinvertebrate fauna in the stream margins. Buffer strips consisting of broadleaf trees and moorland/grassland vegetation have different effects on taxonomic composition and abundance. They are most effective when implemented at the planting stage, though further data are required to assess succession with time where buffer strips have been cleared retrospectively.",,

Feeding apparently did not occur after twilight. Mean stomach content weight was correlated with water temperature on two dates and was never correlated with invertebrate drift density for non-age-0 trout. Daily ration (wet weight) was 7% of live weight for non-age-0 trout and 21% for age-0 trout.

The degree of selectivity varied through 24 h and the interpretation depended on the method of analysis used. Occurrence of low-drift cased Trichoptera larvae in stomachs was correlated with amount of filamentous algae ingested, indicating a degree of epibenthic foraging, although no diel pattern could be reliably discerned. Mean length of prey items in stomachs was larger that the drift in 83% of the samples.

In the case of insects, most published DNA barcoding studies focus on species of the Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera, Hymenoptera and especially Lepidoptera. In this study we test the efficiency of DNA barcoding for true bugs (Hemiptera: Heteroptera), an ecological and economical highly important as well as morphologically diverse insect taxon. As part of our study we analyzed DNA barcodes for 1742 specimens of 457 species, comprising 39 families of the Heteroptera. We found low nucleotide distances with a minimum pairwise K2P distance <2.2% within 21 species pairs (39 species). For ten of these species pairs (18 species), minimum pairwise distances were zero. In contrast to this, deep intraspecific sequence divergences with maximum pairwise distances >2.2% were detected for 16 traditionally recognized and valid species. With a successful identification rate of 91.5% (418 species) our study emphasizes the use of DNA barcodes for the identification of true bugs and represents an important step in building-up a comprehensive barcode library for true bugs in Germany and Central Europe as well. Our study also highlights the urgent necessity of taxonomic revisions for various taxa of the Heteroptera, with a special focus on various species of the Miridae. In this context we found evidence for on-going hybridization events within various taxonomically challenging genera (e.g. Nabis Latreille, 1802 (Nabidae), Lygus Hahn, 1833 (Miridae), Phytocoris Fallén, 1814 (Miridae)) as well as the putative existence of cryptic species (e.g. Aneurus avenius (Duffour, 1833) (Aradidae) or Orius niger (Wolff, 1811) (Anthocoridae)).",,

Human use of land and water resources modifies many streamflow characteristics, which can have significant ecological consequences. Streamflow and invertebrate data collected at 111 sites in the western U.S.A. were analysed to identify streamflow characteristics (magnitude, frequency, duration, timing and variation) that are probably to limit characteristics of benthic invertebrate assemblages (abundance, richness, diversity and evenness, functional feeding groups and individual taxa) and, thus, would be important for freshwater conservation and restoration. Our analysis investigated multiple metrics for each biological and hydrological characteristic, but focuses on 14 invertebrate metrics and 13 streamflow metrics representing the key associations between streamflow and invertebrates. 2. Streamflow is only one of many environmental and biotic factors that influence the characteristics of invertebrate assemblages. Although the central tendency of invertebrate assemblage characteristics may not respond to any one factor across a large region like the western U.S.A., we postulate that streamflow may limit some invertebrates. To assess streamflow characteristics as limiting factors on invertebrate assemblages, we developed a nonparametric screening procedure to identify upper (ceilings) or lower (floors) limits on invertebrate metrics associated with streamflow metrics. Ceilings and floors for selected metrics were then quantified using quantile regression. 3. Invertebrate assemblages had limits associated with all streamflow characteristics that we analysed. Metrics of streamflow variation at daily to inter‐annual scales were among the most common characteristics associated with limits on invertebrate assemblages. Baseflow recession, daily variation and monthly variation, in streamflow were associated with the largest number of invertebrate metrics. Since changes in streamflow variation are often a consequence of hydrologic alteration, they may serve as useful indicators of ecologically significant changes in streamflow and as benchmarks for managing streamflow for ecological objectives. 4. Relative abundance of Plecoptera, richness of non‐insect taxa and relative abundance of intolerant taxa were associated with multiple streamflow metrics. Metrics of sensitive taxa (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera), and intolerant taxa generally had ceilings associated with flow metrics while metrics of tolerant taxa, non‐insects, dominance and chironomids generally had floors. Broader characteristics of invertebrate assemblages such as abundance and richness had fewer limits, but these limits were nonetheless associated with a broad range of streamflow characteristics.",,

Aquatic insects composed 95% and 94% of the surface fauna in the intermittent and perennial streams, respectively, and were dominated by chironomids and caddisflies (e.g., Apatania, Neothremma, Parthina). Noninsects composed 73% and 59% of the hyporheic fauna in the intermittent and perennial streams, respectively, and were dominated by archiannelids and harpacticoid and cyclopoid copepods. Faunal overlap between the intermittent and perennial streams was high (Jaccard coefficient 0.88 for surface fauna and 0.82 for hyporheic fauna). The intermittent stream surface fauna had lower total densities, taxon richness, and species diversity compared to that of the perennial stream; the hyporheic fauna in the intermittent stream had lower densities, similar richness, but higher species diversity.We used a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) design to test the hypothesis that the hyporheic zone serves as a refuge for surface invertebrates when surface flow ceases. If the hyporheic zone serves as a refuge, then hyporheic densities during the dry period should increase in the intermittent stream relative to the perennial stream. However, during the drying process, populations of temporary hyporheic resident invertebrates remained unchanged (Sweltsa) or decreased (Baetis, Parthina, Ceratopogonidae), but densities of the permanent hyporheic resident (Archiannelida) increased.

DNA barcoding provides a solution to this problem by linking newly collected specimens to a reference library of authoritatively identified specimens. Here, we consider the ways in which patterns of intraspecific and interspecific genetic divergences in the barcode region can provide rapid insights into the taxonomic identity, morphological features, and geographical distributions of species. Our study led to a >5× increase in the EPT fauna, including 68 caddisfly, 37 mayfly, and 7 stonefly species, recorded from Churchill. DNA barcoding also aided detection of rare taxa, allowed identification of otherwise unidentifiable life stages, revealed several potentially new species of caddisflies and mayflies, and suggested the presence of cryptic species. The new insights into this fauna and the strong congruence between morphological and molecular characters affirm the utility of DNA barcoding for rapid characterization of the diversity of EPT faunas. We also explore the phenology and habitat preferences of Churchill's trichopterans and demonstrate that comprehensive sampling is important for documenting biodiversity through DNA barcoding.",,

Eight replicate wooden flumes were placed in an unshaded riffle in Augusta Creek, a third—order, hardwater trout stream in southwestern Michigan (USA). Phosphorus, in the form of Ca(H2PO4)2, was added to four of these flumes for 105 d. The average concentration of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) maintained in P—enriched flumes (85 mg/L) was &gt;5 times as great as in control flumes (15 mg/L). After 77 d of nutrient enrichment, periphyton biomass per unit area on substrates with reduced grazer densities was 1.8 x as great in P—enriched flumes as in control flumes. The larvae of two species of grazing caddisflies (Leucotrichia pictipes and Psychomyia flavida) in P—enriched flumes also had higher individuals mass, developmental rates, and population densities. These responses resulted in standing crops of final—instar larvae in P—enriched flumes that were 2.1x and 1.5x as great as those in control flumes for Psychomyia and Leucotrichia, respectively. This demonstration of food limitation supplements previous behavioral studies showing that both grazer species aggressively defend feeding territories, and contributes to a growing body of evidence suggesting that resource limitation is more important in some stream food webs than previously recognized. Resource limitation of these grazer populations may be due in part to the rarity of catastrophic flooding and drying in Augusta Creek. Such stable flows could permit consumer populations to reach higher densities than in frequently disturbed streams.",,

Despite their potential utility, no explicit, phylogeny-based, broad-scale comparative studies of the evolution of gas exchange in insects have been undertaken. This may be due partly to the preponderance of information for the endopterygotes, and its scarcity for the apterygotes and exopterygotes. Here we undertake such a broad-scale study. Information on gas exchange patterns for the large majority of insects examined to date (eight orders, 99 species)is compiled, and new information on 19 exemplar species from a further ten orders, not previously represented in the literature (Archaeognatha,Zygentoma, Ephemeroptera, Odonata, Mantodea, Mantophasmatodea, Phasmatodea,Dermaptera, Neuroptera, Trichoptera), is provided. These data are then used in a formal, phylogeny-based parsimony analysis of the evolution of gas exchange patterns at the order level. Cyclic gas exchange is likely to be the ancestral gas exchange pattern at rest (recognizing that active individuals typically show continuous gas exchange), and discontinuous gas exchange probably originated independently a minimum of five times in the Insecta.",,

Additions were designed to compare human judgement in log placements against a randomized design and an unmanipulated reach, and also to compare effectiveness in a low- and a high-gradient stream. Pool area increased 146% in the systematic placement and 32% in the random placement sections of the low-gradient stream, lending support to the notion that human judgement can be more effective than placing logs at random in low-gradient streams. Conversely, the high-gradient stream changed very little after LWD additions, suggesting that other hydraulic controls such as boulders and bedrock override LWD influences in high-gradient streams. Logs oriented as dams were responsible for all pools created by additions regardless of stream or method of placement. Multiple log combinations created only two pools, while the other seven pools were created by single LWD pieces. Total benthic macroinvertebrate abundance did not change as a result of LWD additions in either stream, but net abundances of Plecoptera, Coleoptera, Trichoptera, and Oligochaeta decreased, while Ephemeroptera increased significantly with the proportional increase in pool area in the low-gradient stream.",,

Current views in ecology emphasise that community structure is the sum of multiple processes, with imprints of both regional and local drivers. However, the degree to which stream insect assemblages are structured by spatial configuration (complying with the dispersal‐based neutral hypothesis) and local environmental features (complying with the niche‐based species sorting hypothesis) has not been rigorously examined based on surveys in multiple years. 2. Stream sites in a boreal drainage system were surveyed during three consecutive years and the relative contribution of spatial configuration and local environmental variables to aquatic insect assemblage structure (characterised by both abundance and presence–absence data) was assessed. Separate analyses were conducted for mayflies (Ephemeroptera), stoneflies (Plecoptera), caddisflies (Trichoptera), and non‐biting midges (Diptera: Chironomidae) in each year. 3. There were no relationships between the spatial location and local environmental features of streams in Mantel tests, facilitating exploration of their independent effects on assemblage structure. The study found virtually no effects of spatial location on stream insect assemblages across the study drainage system, as evidenced by Mantel tests and canonical correspondence analyses (CCA). The environmental variables were also rather weakly associated with assemblage structure, with the total amount of explained variation ranging from 9.8% to 31.7% in the CCAs. There were no appreciable differences in the amount of environment‐related explained variation in assemblage structure between mayflies, stoneflies, caddisflies, and midges, but some between‐year differences were noticeable in most insect groups. The environmental variables that were significantly related to assemblage structure exhibited some between‐group and between‐year variability. In general, patterns shown by abundance and presence–absence data were highly similar. 4. It appears that stream insect assemblages comply with the niche‐based species sorting hypothesis in the context of metacommunity ecology. In contrast, the absence of spatial structuring suggests that stream insect assemblages do not comply with the neutral hypothesis, being not strongly dispersal limited at the within‐drainage basin scale.",,

Climate changes can interact with other environmental changes to determine structural and functional attributes of communities. Although such complex interactions are most likely to occur in a multiple‐stressor context as frequently encountered in large rivers, they have received little attention in such ecosystems. In this study, we aimed at specifically addressing the issue of relative long‐term effects of global and local changes on benthic macroinvertebrate communities in multistressed large rivers. We assessed effects of hydroclimatic vs. water quality factors on invertebrate community structure and composition over 30 years (1979–2008) in the M iddle L oire R iver, F rance. As observed in other large E uropean rivers, water warming over the three decades (+0.9 °C between 1979–1988 and 1999–2008) and to a lesser extent discharge reduction (−80 m 3 s −1 ) were significantly involved in the disappearance or decrease in taxa typical from fast running, cold waters (e.g. C hloroperlidae and P otamanthidae). They explained also a major part of the appearance and increase of taxa typical from slow flowing or standing waters and warmer temperatures, including invasive species (e.g. C orbicula sp . and A tyaephyra desmarestii ). However, this shift towards a generalist and pollution tolerant assemblage was partially confounded by local improvement in water quality (i.e. phosphate input reduction by about two thirds and eutrophication limitation by almost one half), explaining a significant part of the settlement of new pollution‐sensitive taxa (e.g. the caddisfly B rachycentridae and P hilopotamidae families) during the last years of the study period. The regain in such taxa allowed maintaining a certain level of specialization in the invertebrate community despite climate change effects.",,

Management of stream biodiversity is often tightly linked with the restoration and protection of riparian and catchment vegetation. Despite that, there are no established guidelines on how much forest should be retained or replanted in riparian zones and surrounding catchments to maintain or re‐establish instream ecological integrity. In this study, we assess relationships between vegetation cover at multiple spatial scales (reach, segment and catchment) and macroinvertebrate metrics that reflect community structure, ecological condition and biodiversity at 138 Waikato, New Zealand, stream sites sampled in 2006. 2. Percentage of catchment vegetation in native forest had stronger relationships with measured diversity and condition metrics than segment or reach scale measures of riparian vegetation. Functional feeding group metrics were weakly associated with upstream catchment vegetation cover. 3. Of the macroinvertebrate metrics tested, the RIVPAC O/E and an organic pollution tolerance metric based on species presence–absence (Macroinvertebrate Community Index; MCI) had the strongest relationships with percentage native riparian vegetation, followed by the quantitative MCI and measures of the richness and relative abundance of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera faunas. The O/E and MCI indicated that catchments with 80–90% in native forest or scrub (low‐growing trees) were associated with faunas indicative of “clean” water quality. 4. Of the biodiversity indices considered Fisher’s α Index of species richness had the strongest relationship with percent native riparian vegetation in the upstream catchment. There are no established thresholds for measuring biodiversity loss in New Zealand streams, but this analysis indicates that on average streams draining catchments with 40–60% upstream native vegetation cover retain 80% of the mean biodiversity present in pristine forest streams. 5. This research indicates that riparian management aimed at enhancing macroinvertebrate biodiversity and the ecological condition of streams is likely to be more successful when focused on protecting and/or restoring headwater catchments rather than short stretches of stream.",,

Major molecular adaptations allowing underwater spinning of an ancestral dry silk appear to have been phosphorylation of serines and the accumulation of basic residues in the silk proteins. The amphoteric nature of the silk proteins could contribute to silk fiber assembly through electrostatic association of phosphorylated blocks with arginine-rich blocks.

However, their degree of sensitivity and the most reliable metrics for the bioassessment program development are very poorly studied in Togo. This study aimed to test the sensitivity of metrics calculated at the family and genus levels. A total of 21 water quality parameters and macroinvertebrates' data were collected during three periods at 20 sampling sites within the Zio River. The canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), factor analysis (FA), and Spearman's correlation analysis were conducted on water quality parameters and macroinvertebrates' data. The results reveal that macroinvertebrate structure and composition were affected by water quality parameters related to human disturbances. In this study, three groups of macroinvertebrate communities were identified including sensitive taxa such as Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera, and Odonata (EPTO) taxa; the resistant or resilient taxa such as Oligochaeta, Hirudinea, Diptera, and Pulmonates (OHDP) taxa; and tolerant taxa such as Prosobranchia, Bivalvia, Lepidoptera, Heteroptera, and Coleoptera (PBLHC). All the 13 macroinvertebrate-based metrics were found to be sensitive in the detection of water quality and human disturbance gradients. However, metrics related to EPTO and the tolerance measure [multimetric index of the Zio River basin (MMIZB), Average Score per Taxon (ASPT), and Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP)] are the most robust in discrimination of pressure gradients.

The diversity of species traits in a biological assemblage varies not only with species richness, but also with species evenness and organism density, which together influence the concentration of traits within functional guilds. Potential trait diversity at local scales is also constrained by the regional species pool. Implications of such variation for spatio-temporal variability in biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships are likely to be complex, but are poorly understood. 2. In microcosm experiments conducted at laboratories in Sweden, Ireland and Romania, we investigated effects of species richness, evenness and density of stream-living detritivores on two related processes: detritivore leaf-processing efficiency (LPE) and growth. Assemblage composition varied among laboratories: one taxonomic order (Plecoptera) was studied in Sweden, whereas two orders, encompassing wider trait variation, were studied in Romania (Trichoptera and Plecoptera) and Ireland (Trichoptera and Isopoda). 3. Relationships between density and both LPE and growth ranged from negative to positive across the study species, highlighting the potential for density-dependent variation in process rates to alter ecosystem functioning, but indicating that such effects depend on species identity. 4. LPE varied with species diversity in the two more heterogeneous assemblages, but whereas LPE in the Romanian study was generally enhanced as richness increased, LPE in the Irish study increased only in less-even polycultures dominated by particular species. Transgressive overyielding was detected in the Irish experiment, indicating complementary resource use and/or facilitation (complementarity). These mechanisms could not be distinguished from the selection effect in the Romanian study. 5. Growth was elevated in Romanian species mixtures, reflecting positive complementarity, but lower than expected growth in some Swedish mixtures was associated with negative complementarity, indicating interspecific interference competition. 6. Our results emphasize the potential importance of detritivore diversity for stream ecosystem functioning, but both the effects of diversity on the studied processes, and the mechanisms underlying those effects, were specific to each assemblage and process. Such variability highlights challenges in generalizing impacts of diversity change for functional integrity in streams and other ecosystems in which the occurrence of important species traits fluctuates over relatively small spatio-temporal scales.",,

Insects that lay eggs in water are especially attracted to such structures because these insects use horizontal polarization of light off bodies of water to find egg‐laying sites. Thus, these sources of polarized light can become ecological traps associated with reproductive failure and mortality in organisms that are attracted to them and by extension with rapid population declines or collapse. Solar panels are a new source of polarized light pollution. Using imaging polarimetry, we measured the reflection–polarization characteristics of different solar panels and in multiple‐choice experiments in the field we tested their attractiveness to mayflies, caddis flies, dolichopodids, and tabanids. At the Brewster angle, solar panels polarized reflected light almost completely (degree of polarization d ≈ 100%) and substantially exceeded typical polarization values for water ( d ≈ 30–70%). Mayflies (Ephemeroptera), stoneflies (Trichoptera), dolichopodid dipterans, and tabanid flies (Tabanidae) were the most attracted to solar panels and exhibited oviposition behavior above solar panels more often than above surfaces with lower degrees of polarization (including water), but in general they avoided solar cells with nonpolarizing white borders and white grates. The highly and horizontally polarizing surfaces that had nonpolarizing, white cell borders were 10‐ to 26‐fold less attractive to insects than the same panels without white partitions. Although solar panels can act as ecological traps, fragmenting their solar‐active area does lessen their attractiveness to polarotactic insects. The design of solar panels and collectors and their placement relative to aquatic habitats will likely affect populations of aquatic insects that use polarized light as a behavioral cue.",,

Perch, unlike roach and ruffe, undergoes dramatic ontogenetic diet shifts. The decrease in the abundance of perch along the productivity gradient may be due to competition from roach at its plankton—feeding stage and from ruffe at its benthic—macroinvertebrate—feeding stage. Previous studies of these three species have focused on the effects of roach on the other species. To further examine the competitive relationship among these species, we studied the effect of increasing the density of ruffe, while maintaining a relatively high, constant density of roach, on the diet and growth of perch. Food resources were also monitored during this 2—mo experiment, which was conducted in 10 enclosures in a pond in southern Sweden. Based on prior experiments we expected roach, an efficient planktivore, to reduce the biomass of zooplankton in all enclosures. Moreover, we expected that the increased density of benthic—feeding ruffe would force perch to increase its consumption of zooplankton, resulting in reduced growth. We found, as predicted, that the biomass of cladocerans of copepods decreased over time but was not affected by ruffe density. The biomass of the commonly consumed macroinvertebrates Sialis (a megalopteran), trichopterans, and ephemeropterans was lower in enclosures with ruffe than in enclosures without ruffe. Moreover, the biomass of Sialis decreased and that of chironomids and the clam Pisidium increased over time. High ruffe densities were related to an increased proportion of zooplankton in the diet of perch in August, but not in September. The diet of ruffe changed little along the ruffe gradient. Only the proportion of trichopterans (in August) and Pisidium (in September) in the diet of ruffe increased along the ruffe gradient. The growth of both perch and ruffe decreased with increasing ruffe density, whereas the growth of roach was constant. These data suggest that one reason perch decrease in abundance along a productivity gradient may be because they are competitively sandwiched between plantivore and benthivore specialists.",,
